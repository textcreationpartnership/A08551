            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT is recorded in holy writ (most worthy Sir) how that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Emperor &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander of <hi>127</hi> Prouinces, being by deſerts of a stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſubiect, bound to deeds of gratitude, the which as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing no occaſion to expreſſe, &amp; fearing to drowne them in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion, cauſed it to be enrolled in the Annales of his acts, that the reading thereof might after remember him, how thoſe merits being by him left vnrecompenced, he still ought to guerdon. So fell it out that turning ouer the Chronicles of his age, and calling to memorie his debt, he did with magnifike honor ſufficiently diſcharge it. This conſideration many waies well pondered, whether, ô whether may I fly for refuge? For not content to haue tranſgreſt againſt the ſacred vertue of thankefulnes, due for your benefits in number infinite, I haue (but vnwilling) ſinned against your loue, and wronged your kindnes, by violating my willing promiſe made to your request (yet due by dutie) to viſite you this laſt vacation in the countrey: which fault I greatly feare hath, (I muſt needs ſay) deſeruedly incurred your diſfauour. But as the incenſed heauens are by true contritio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vnfained penitence appeaſed of their wrath: So doe I not doubt but my lawfull excuſe, &amp; this cauſe thereof ſhall purchaſe an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your diſpleaſure, &amp; my offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which first of all by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I hope wilbe leſſened, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your pardon waſhing away my ſinne, in ſigne of a thankefull debtor for all your bounties, I ſacrifize my ſelfe &amp; this motiue of my tranſgreſſion on the Altar of your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, where the fier of my penitent hart, conſuming the oblation, it may cleare my paſſage to your reconciled grace from all obsticles of your anger. I must of force confeſſe it is an idle toy, hacht and brought forth at idle times, and therefore neither worthy your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Great and incredible was the pleaſure that the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, beholding from the hatches the delightfull proſpect of this ſoule-pleaſing Countrey, where willingly he would haue ſtrucke his ſayles, accepting the kinde welcome of the chirping byrdes, whoſe chéerefull notes according with the ſoft bubbling of the running ſtreames of litle Riuerets, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing twixt the trées, made ſuch a melodious conſort of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Muſicke, that it had almoſt rauiſhed his ſenſes, and drowned his intended voyage in obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

To be ſhort, with incredible ſpéede &amp; delight, he compaſſed the moſt part of the orbed earth: for being acquited of Loues tributarie dueties, his quiet mind had the more ſcope to ſubiugate his thoughts to admiration of theſe things. So that now wearie of eaſe, he wiſhed an end vnto his trauaile, that he might agayne exerciſe his often tryed forces, to augment the perpetuitie of his glories, which he thought were ecclipſed in the obſcure cabbin of his honor-ſmothering bark, yet he ſtil perſwaded himſelfe ſome great aduenture could not but awayt the end of this Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable toyle. At length paſſing the Ilands <hi>Sygares,</hi> in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times called <hi>Sydromades,</hi> (whoſe coaſtes to vnſkilfull paſſengers is pitileſſe death) ſome fiue dayes after, he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, where vpon a morne, when glittering <hi>Phaebus</hi> mounted his fierie Carre, the boate ran aſhoare to the Princes great contentment, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tyred with this long nauigation.

So with an eaſie pace they trauailed not long that way, but it brought them into a great wood, whoſe vnknowen paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſomewhat amazed the <hi>Dacian</hi> Lord. Yet was it no part to expell the great delight he did conceaue with the ſoft whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling murmure of the pleaſant windes, that ſeemed to daunce vpon the mouing of the ſhaken leaues, on whome the whiſtling byrdes warbled their ditties in ſuch accordant manner, that agreeing in one conſort of an inartificiall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, it arreſted the amazed conceipt of the wandring Prince, that continued his iourney along a Chriſtal Riueret whoſe bending turnings brought him at laſt vnto his ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging head, whoſe purling brooke from a rockie quarie traced

This pleaſant ſpring was all incompaſſed with high creſſend trees, proud Cedars, and loftie Pynes, whoſe height ſeemed to controll the firmament aloft, and ſcorne the lower plants beneath; whoſe humble growth was accompanied with greene Palmes, freſh Oliues, and odoriferous Orange trees, that euer flouriſheth with ſpringing habits. Through theſe (vpon the dyaperd ground, with flowered tapeſtrie) ranne the ſportful wanton yong Deare, that in aboundance increaſed the pleaſure of this wooddie fount: for ſome ſcud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded along to out-ſtrip the others in running: others, nibled the tender growing ſapplings, and others togither butted in wrangling paſtime their horned foreheads. The <hi>Dacian</hi> wrapt in a ſuddein admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the vnhoped ſight of ſuch miracles, reſted confounded in pleaſant imaginations that perſwaded him in a land ſo wonderfull of Natures wonders he ſhould not but expect ſome vnlooked, vnconceaued, and unmerited happineſſe. Here to eaſe himſelfe awhile, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, and waſhed his ſweatie face &amp; hands in thoſe coole refreſhing waters, and then ſitting on the graſſe, ſatisfied his hungrie ſtomack with ſuch prouiſion as <hi>Fabio</hi> his page had brought with him from his ſhip. The collation ended, they diſcourſed of many matters (to beguyle the time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) eſpecially, touching the <hi>Romane</hi> Ladies, whoſe affection towards him ſhewen by the Princeſſe <hi>Roſelia,</hi> was not of meane reſpect: wherevpon <hi>Fabio</hi> tooke occaſion thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne.</p>
               <p>I cannot (deare Lord) ſufficiently conceaue the hidden reaſons of your ſtrange proceedings in Loue. For when I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber your extreame paſſions for the firſt robber of your
<pb facs="tcp:13977:5"/>
heart <hi>Floriſdama,</hi> your ſecond doting on <hi>Lidea,</hi> &amp; your laſt affection towards <hi>Roſelia,</hi> with the maner of your ſudden departure from her without a farewell in recompence of her many fauors, which her accepting you for hers, condemnes you in the higheſt degree of ingratitude in Loue beſides her many other merites (which I liſt not now memorate) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued no ſuch ſleight eſteeme. The conſideration of which things drownes my witts in vncertaine thoughts. Do you thinke when ſhee ſhall record her courteſies and your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſies, ſhe will not call you a diſſembling <hi>Dacian?</hi> a flattering friend? &amp; a wauering changing Louer? Wil ſhe not complaine of her ill aboading ſtarres? exclame on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune? and banne your remembrance? Nay, how can ſhee otherwiſe hauing ſo great cauſe thereto. For ſhame (my Lord) awake your ſlumbring ſences, and rayze vp againe the broken ruynes of your decaying credit, let not the honor of your byrth be tainted? nor the royall blood of <hi>Dacia</hi> ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an infamous blott of thankleſſe ingratitude? Let not Roomes quarrell begunne in the fathers, continue in the children, and be ended (God knowes) in what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie. But pardon me (my Lord) for thus paſſing the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of duety and the duetie of a ſeruant, which only loue and zeale to your reputation hath moued me vnto. In deede <hi>Fabio</hi> (replied the Prince,) firſt thanking thee for thy care, I muſt confeſſe in ſome reſpect I ſtand guiltie in <hi>Roſelias</hi> ſight, for departing without her conſent. But yet God knowes it was not either by negligent forgetting, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully reiecting her deſerued merits, or the ſleight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of her kindneſſe, for which, and for her infinite fauors, I euer ſhall reſt debtor. But leauing this, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the heauens in their iuſt doome haue not allotted her to me (although her perfection a greater Monarche do deſerue then me) which I do the more beleeue becauſe my truſty friend <hi>Nabato</hi> did aſſure me, it touched me as neare as my life, not to ſpeake to her at my departure: which I (with ſome vnwillingneſſe) agreed vnto, hoping the Princeſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:6"/>
(knowing my power to be yoked vnder her commaund) would not take any ſerious conceipt at ſo ſleight a treſpas. Yea but (quoth <hi>Fabio</hi>) women are ſo grieued by euery ſmall occaſion, that little offences wayghed in their feminine ſcales, are found to be excuſes of inconſtancie and ſelfe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering affection, and therefore are taken in the worſte part: For commonly women conceiue whatſoeuer is done for them, muſt (for ſo reaſon requireth) proceede of duetie: chiefely if moued by any amorous inclination: &amp; hers was not little, if I may beleeue her exterior motions, when you were fierceſt in your combate. For by no better meanes doth a louer expreſſe his loue towardes the thing loued, then when it is ſeene in any perill, how ſmall ſoeuer, which things adde ſuch credit to my doubt, that I certainly beleeue ſhee hath vttered a thouſand complaints againſt you, moued with that inward and entyre affection ſhee beares you. And to conclude, her rare beawtie deſerueth more then I can or am able to expreſſe.</p>
               <p>This conference was here abruptly broke off with the pleaſant crie (that ſtopped the <hi>Dacian</hi> lords reply) of a ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of wel-mouthed hounds, whoſe noiſe ecchoing through the wood, gaue him warning of ſome hunting ſport, whoſe game ſhould already be on foote. As he was thus harke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he ſawe comming towards him with impetous fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a mighty white Hart, with the whole troope of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing enemies at his heeles, who wearie and faint with chaſe, came to refreſh him in that brooke. This courſe highly pleaſing the Prince (hauing bene in his youth brought vp with ſuch exerſiſe, ſnatched his launce, and as the Hart paſſed by, threwe it at him, and pierced his bodie ſide through ſide, and yet not brake his ſpeare, and as a cunning huntſman he harted the hounds vpon their praie, expecting for the hunters comming. But from theſe dumps he was quickly put with the ſudden viewe of a moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Ladie, that mounted on a gallant courſer, galloped after the Hart: her habit was of greene cut vpon white, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered
<pb facs="tcp:13977:6"/>
with ſo many Pearles &amp; ſtones, that it dazled the beholders eyes when the bright beames of <hi>Apollos</hi> face re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerberated thereon, her amber haire in golden tramels hung about her ſhoulders, and on her head ſhe wore a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet of Roſes that defended her againſt the offending heat of <hi>Phaebus</hi> rayes. And as ſhe came in haſt, her dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling treſſes wauered in the ayre, that he aſſured him ſelfe that this was <hi>Cupids</hi> warre, ſeing his enſigne of her haire borne by ſuch beautie, and defended with a Boar-ſpeare, which ſhe carried in her hand: who in this manner appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched our <hi>Dacian</hi> Knight, that with this firſt and ſole ſight became the little blind triumphing gods ſighes-tributary ſubiect, and by immagination loſt the pleaſure of his former libertie by gazing on ſo gallant a Ladie, that he acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe Loues captiue thrall, vowing in his hart ſuch firmeneſſe, that his thoughts drouned in conceipts, ſtrucke him with ſuch a fearefull hope, that he almoſt loſt his breathing ſenſes, whereby the vnextinguiſhing flames of true loues fire ſo penetrated his free hart, that none but death could be the Phiſicke to cure ſo deepe a wound. The engyne of his ſpeach ſo ceaſt his motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in ſteed therof, he wiſht all his moouing powers, were then tranſformed to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny piercing inſtruments of ſight throughly to viewe her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and yet did he thinke them inſufficient to note all her perfections, becauſe ſomething would ſtill remaine vnſeen. Gladly would he haue changed his preſent ſtate for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eied <hi>Argos</hi> fortunes (though he ſhould pay as dearly for his watching) if hee mought at his contented leyſure, ſuruay all the excellencies, that glorious <hi>Nature</hi> in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie had beſtowed on her. For in his penſiue cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he iudged this was ſhee the iuſt heauens had ordained to predominate his heart, his life, ſoule and will, &amp; to whom he ſhould acknowledge all ſoueraignetie ouer his due obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, alreadie eſteeming his nauigable toiles well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, ſince they brought him to ſo rich a land, to ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his wearie minde within the harbour of ſo braue a
<pb facs="tcp:13977:7"/>
Road. To be ſhort, the haughtie inuincible courage of his free thoughts, were ſo amazed with this admirable gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it could by no meanes reſiſt ſo ſtrong incounter, but without farther combate, (for Fortitude is too weake to withſtand the dartes of beautie) preſently yeelded her his ſoule as a trophie of her victorie, and yet reſted ſorrowfull, he had no richer pryzes to glorifie her triumphs, becauſe her merits deſerued a greater conqueſt. So much amazed reſted this valiant <hi>Dacian,</hi> as if altogither he were conuerted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladie, on whome his gazing eyes were fixed, &amp; ſo greatly, that being nigh her, he could neither moue the organs of his voice, nor ought elſe, but by ſignes ſignifie, his awfull dutie at her commaund, being all in all hers. With no leſſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration did the valiant Ladie with her eyes coate his wonders, becauſe her troubled thoughts told her (that from her infancie) ſhee had neuer ſeene a more brauer Knight. And as Ladies comonly in ſuch accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of amorous traun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue a freer power of their ſpeech: ſo ſhee perceiuing the ſuddeine alteration of his colour-changing countenance, faining ſome diſpleaſure (that in like caſes followeth all Ladies of her beautie and valour) ſhee awaked him with theſe words.</p>
               <p>I know not (Knight) what moued you ſo raſhly to kill this Hart, bereauing me of the pleaſure that awayted my comming: and he expected by receiuing his death at my hands: whereof your preſumption by doing it, hath diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt vs both of. <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> drawing ſtrength from his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht ſoule, replyed: My poore hart (moſt excellent Lady) doth alreadie ſuffer his deſerued penaunce, for ſo ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your content. Yet do I hope this offence, confeſſing the fault, ſhal be abſolued of your diſpleaſure, hauing been through a wel-meaning ignorance committed. For ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing none would except againſt mee, or take diſpleaſure at it, incitated me thereto. But good hath bene his exchange: for in ſteede of the death he receiued (being ordained therto) with no leſſe a wound haue your (deuine excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies) pierced
<pb facs="tcp:13977:7"/>
my ſoule bycauſe the impartiall fates (I feare) will ſooner cut my thréed of life, then you will daygne the cure, to ſalue the wound wounded by your ſelfe. Farre more haue you now aggrauated my diſcontent (anſwered the Lady) recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing greater diſpleaſure at your bolde wordes, then did the poore Hart with death by your Launce. Anſwere would y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> amorous <hi>Dacian,</hi> but that he ſaw a Knight well armed and mounted on a mighty horſe, iſſue from among the trees, who hauing ouer heard part of <hi>Don Elenos</hi> ſpeech, cryed out vnto him.</p>
               <p>Knight more bold then valiant, take vp thy weapons, for ſo great a preſumption may not paſſe vnpuniſhed. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Dacian</hi> was ſo captiuated with the beautie of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that his deepe affection (ſeeing that Knight in ſo gallant armour and ſo brauely Horſt) made him thinke he was his Loues competitor. Whereat a ſudden thought of Ielouſie rapt at his breaſt, that without any word, taking vp his ſhield, he laced on his healme: and with more ſpeede then the Hart came thether, he drew his Launce out of his dead body, leaping therewith into his <hi>Tyrios</hi> ſaddle, &amp; in his hand brandiſhing the ſpeare, he turned to his aduerſary with theſe words: Diſcourteous Knight, coragious in nothing but in words: nowe ſhalt thou ſee how I vſe to thanke thoſe that with like pride entertaine others as you haue me. Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full became the beauteous Lady, to ſee them ſo eager againſt each other, greatly fearing the ſucceſſe of the fight, becauſe ſhe thought the ſtranger would haue the better: but ſeeing them ſo fierce, withdrew her ſelfe, praying for both their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories: For if ſhe affects the one as her brother, the other ſhe loues, as her liues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander. And as ſhe was a nouice new admitted in <hi>Cupids</hi> Schoole, with ſuch willingneſſe ſhee yeilded to his deceipts, that with one and the like feare he forſt her to be Iudge of that combate. Couragious was the Knight of the forreſt, but hee hath before him the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince with ſuch haughtie thoughts, that <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe would haue feared him. With furie at length they mette in
<pb facs="tcp:13977:8"/>
middle of their courſe with moſt ſtrong incounters: But the <hi>Dacians</hi> Horſe being the beſt in the world, meeting with his aduerſaries, tumbled him on the ground, and with a mighty fall made his Maiſter meaſure his length on the earth, himſelfe ſtumbling at a ſpeares ſtruchon. Whereat the Prince fearing ſome miſchance, ſeeing him ſo ſtagger, leapte from him with ſuch nimbleneſſe, that his gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as much delighted the Lady, as it grieued her to ſee her brothers diſgrace, who fearing a ſudden death, with his ſword drawne, and his ſhield wel buckled about his arme, made towards our Knight, that in like manner expected him, deſirous to prooue the cutting of his <hi>Romaine</hi> blade, wherewith he laide vpon the toppe of his enemies ſhield entring it with ſuch might, that al that quarter with a pece of his helme he threwe to the ground. He ſeconded another not ſo dangerous, yet more fearfull, becauſe lighting on his breaſt, it gaue him a wide wound. Trembling ſtood the Lady at her brothers chance, though he like a valiant war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſetting his right foote forward ſo ſtruck him on the leggs, that had his ſword been like the <hi>Dacians,</hi> he hadd greatly hazarded his victorie. Forward he ſtept with his other foote, to make a ſtronger blowe, and ſo thruſting at him with his point, it chanced between the buckles of his ſkirts, that had he not turn'd aſide, he had there been ſlaine out-right, notwithſtanding it made him a little wounde, whereout iſſued ſome blood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dacian</hi> thinking it to be greater, like a furious <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> before he was able to withdraw him, vpon the little left him of his ſhield gaue him ſuch a blow, that parting it from one end to the other, and the point ſlycing all the armour of his arme, he threw his ſhield on the ground leauing all that ſide without defence. With the feare of death reſted the Knight amazed, but incouraging himſelfe, with his ſword in both hands, he made againſt his aduerſarie diſcharging on his ſhield ſo braue a blow, that falling on his head, he forſt him to retire backe, with ſtaggering ſtepps, which ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:8"/>
he followed the aduantage, &amp; with a point had almoſt ouerthrowne him. But our new Louer firmely ſtaied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, rayſing aloft his <hi>Romain</hi> murthering ſword, at ſuch time as the Ladie getting to her Horſe cried out. Knights withdraw your ſelues, for this is no combate, any farther to proceede? But ſhe came too late, for ere ſhee mounted, her brother groaned his laſt falling on the earth with his head parted in two, which ſudden death grieued euen the very ſoule of the vanguiſht victorious <hi>Dacian:</hi> But what the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Lady did, admits no compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for caſting her ſelfe from her Horſe, all the moouing motions of her breathing ſenſes left her ſo diſpoſeſt of Life, as they hadde the Prince with this vnlook'd for accident. He vnlaced his helme, and ſitting on the blood-dewd graſſe, he tooke the amazed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies head betweene his hands, (which he durſt doe bycauſe the weapons of her excellencies through a pale aſhie trance had left her beautie without defenſiue armes) and began to vſe thoſe meanes for her recouerie, that his braue heart did neuer ſtudy, and with bitter exclaimes he ſaide. Oh cruell fortune may it be, thou ſhouldeſt ſo ſoon temper with ſo ſower a chance, the firſt time thou wouldeſt a little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor me? Oh wiſe <hi>Nabato</hi> my profeſſed friend, why didſt thou tell me thy care ſhould alwaies be to cure my woes, if all things now conſpire againſt me to ouerthrowe my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? In his owne helme hee cauſed ſome water to bee brought him, and ſprinckled it vpon the Ladies faire face, till with a ſighe proceeding from her oppreſſed ſoule ſhe return'd vnto her ſelfe: yet for all this did ſhe remember the pitifull lamentes that the Knight hadde vttered, and that the force of Loue did onely force him to: But ſéeing the brother that ſhe moſt affected, lye before her beſmeared with his owne blood, ſo cruelly ſlaine, ſhe ſtepte from the Prince ſaying. Let mee goe (rude and diſcourteous Knight) for the wronges you haue gainſt me committed, cannot be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with leſſe then the heart blood of your deareſt life. And caſting her ſelfe on the dead carcaſe with ſuch pitifull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:9"/>
that it would haue drawne teares from a <hi>Tygers</hi> eies, ſhe wailed her brothers loſſe, and drowning his head and face, with a pearled ſhower of water diſtilling from her two clowdie founts, ſhe thus began her plaintes. May it be (deare brother) that the angrye Heauens ſhould ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their happie reuolutions againſt our youth, ſuffering the cruell fates to perſecute thee and me with ſo lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a chaunce kept in ſtore by that conſtant Lady of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie, giuing the world ſo great a loſſe thorow thy vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death? who ſhall dare carye the vnlucky newes of thy vnhappie end vnto our Parents? Oh Princes of <hi>Callidonia,</hi> now muſt you take new weapons, and put on armour of reuenge, and build an alter to <hi>Rhamnuſia,</hi> offering thereon the cruell ſacrifizes of <hi>Nemeſis</hi> bloodie rites, that ſhe maye further your reuenging thoughts to take ſo iuſt a vengance. For you haue this day loſt a Prince of the beſt, the braueſt. Ah tender youth ſo ſuddenly bereaft, and ill enioyed? Oh pittileſſe inhumane death, with what extreames doſt thou performe thy cruelties? hauing without mercie or reſpect of innocencie, with ſuch barbarous ſauageneſſe ſnacht from hence my poore <hi>Larſyno,</hi> on whome the enuious worlde had placed all her hopes? And if impartiall deſtinies, inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Siſters, you had determined this partiall doome, within the conſiſtorie of your counſell houſe, why ſuffred you not (ſterne goddeſſes) my brothers mortall wound, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to fall on me and end in my hart, and not leaue mee thus with life to feele ſo many deathes? Thus did that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Ladie poure forth her ſorowes, for her deare <hi>Larſyno.</hi> But the inraged paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> did poſſeſſe <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> when he vnderſtood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſlaine her brother, whom he loued more then his owne ſoule, had almoſt forced him with his owne dagger to drawe his owne harts blood, to pacifie her rage, if he had not feared eternall damnacion, for ſo great a ſinne, yet eſteemed he that a profitable death, where nothing was hoped but what ſhould be more cruell. For all this he ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his drooping heart, and turning to the weepyng
<pb facs="tcp:13977:9"/>
Lady, ſayde. Seing my more then vnhappie fortune (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Lady) hath permitted he ſhould diſpleaſe you, and in this ſort, that was only borne to adore you, ſoly deſiring life to pleaſe you, bethinke what ſatiſfaction you will haue, (though it be with the deareſt blood chambred in my ſoule) and at your command, theſe hands ſhall ſluce it forth, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with ſuch a death, my life will end with ioy, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing it may extenuate part of your diſcontent conceaued. Any reuenge (moſt cruell Knight, replied the ſorowfull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) will be but little, in recompence of the highe wronge I haue receiued by thoſe murthering handes, guiltie of my proper blood. But for this time I will no other reuenge but your departure from my company, leauing me ſufficiently aſſured of your cruelty to my coſt: and I will liue (for my miſfortune will haue it ſo) with the only deſire of a more full reuenge. Wherefore from hencefoorth I ſtraight doe baniſh you my ſight, for I will haue it ſo. If I ſhall depart in your diſgrace (moſt beauteous Lady) I will not haue my life with your diſfauour to torment me (replied the Prince) but ſince you deſire to be reuenged on him that only would liue to admire you, take it with this ſword cawſer of your woes, and my miſfortune, and therewith ſtrike of my ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fized head to appeaſe your wrath, for I willingly offer it on your pities altar, with all I elſe poſſeſſe already ſubiect to your will, and only this doe praie that after you haue done it, you would rent forth my harte (for none ſhall witneſſe your crueltie but your ſelfe) and there ſhall you ſee your ſelfe engrauen, though not ſo naturally, yet with rarer perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: reaſons ſuffcient to force me to elect you ſole patroneſſe thereof: The which remaining in your handes, (being loues thrall) may moue clemencie towardes his Lord, to ſturre your anger to pitie your captiue, euen with his owne reliques.</p>
               <p>Wherewith proſtrated on his knees before her, with his eies cloſed with water, holding the ſword by the point, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thus ſaid. If only in my death (great Ladie) there
<pb facs="tcp:13977:10"/>
reſts any ſmall comforte, for mee it will bee the greateſt that I may imagine, receiuing it with this blade by your hands, for Guerdon of my raſhe attempts: although, if I had knowne what this dead increaſer of your griefes did concerne you, my ſelfe had only been the procurer of his life with farr greater care, then for my owne, which wil be hatefull to mee, if ſtill you will inſiſt in your conceaued wrath. Knight (ſaid ſhe) more barbarous, then the Sauages of <hi>Hircania,</hi> and the cruelleſt that ere my eies beheld, thus I will not execute my reuenge, for it will not be ſo cal'd, performed with the offenders liking: and bycauſe you ſaid, it is life and the ſweeteſt, to bereaue you thereof with my handes, neither will I therin ſo much content you, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and ſollicite the heauens, to order my reuenge after ſome other ſorte. The afflicted Prince hearing ſo ſower and bitter anſwere conceaued ſuch extreame griefe, which with ſobbes and ſighes ſo beſieged his harte, that it bereſt him of his ſenſes, falling at his Ladies feete, which was another new kind of torment to afflict her, for abandoning all cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, ſhe tooke him in her armes, and ſitting on the ground ſhe laid his head on her lappe (which had the grieued <hi>Dacian</hi> felt, he would not ſo ſoone recouer himſelfe) and bewailed this lamentable ſpectacle with new laments, that moued the tender Ladye to breake into theſe exclaymes.</p>
               <p>Oh blind deſpightfull Fortune, enemy to my reſt, how well haſt thou manifeſted thy mutabilities, hauing ſo well pleaded for the greateſt enemie I had, that I am forſt to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerate his woes, and pitie his diſtreſſe? Oh Goddeſſe, who might certenly knowe if with my death ſhe would end her rigorous changing courſes? execute at once againſt my tenderneſſe the whole power of thy deſpight? for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrongs paſt hauing been the greateſt that might befall mee, or thou do mee, will I with ioy accept, bycauſe I know they come from thee, for ſhe that was borne to no good, can receaue no harme to hurt her, and with this deceipt may ſhe paſſe her life, that in the beginning hath felt the vtmoſt of thy cruell
<pb facs="tcp:13977:10"/>
power? Oh cruell Goddeſſe vnworthie of a better name, becauſe in all thy actions thou performeſt the deedes of an <hi>Hircanian Tyger.</hi> And being vnable to doe otherwiſe, ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Fabio</hi> to bring her ſome water, wherewith the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed youth obtained his loſte ſenſes, and with a ſighe that ſeemed to burſt his weake harte, he ſaide.</p>
               <p>Vnhappy ſtars that gouern'd my natiuitie, and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie I to liue to ſee my woes to conquer death, that dares not approche where he is onely wiſhed, with his crueltie to end a life oppreſſed with cares? Oh vnfortunate hap who would haue thought ſo long and tedious a nauigation ſhould anchor in ſo vnluckie a Port? Oh valiant friends, now muſt I for euer in abſence with ayrie words take my lateſt leaue, for my fates ſaye, he ſhall neuer ſee you more that onely liued with your deare ſights. Oh valiant Princes of <hi>Grecia,</hi> what balefull newes will it be, when you ſhall heare of my death, whoſe life alwaies and content, ſoly delighted yee? And ſeeing himſelfe in the Ladies lappe, a little lifting vp his eyes (with ſo many ſighes, and throbbing ſobbs, that might haue mooued a <hi>Lions</hi> fiercenes to relent, but to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt point was this Ladies furie come, that it would admit no Impreſſion of any mercy, vnleſſe it ſhould alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether yeeld to pittie, which ſhe thought was yet too ſoone to doe) he ſayd. Since no pietie, noe pittie, nor no mercie, (that are the vertues which glorifies all your ſexe) maye ſturr a litle compaſſion in your obdurate breaſt, then at once (cruell Lady) end the tormenting of my poore ſoule, with ſo long prolonging a deſpiſed life, and take what reuenge you will on this weeping hart ſubiect to your Imanitie. Knight (anſwered the Lady) ill would it beſeeme me, if by yeelding to your requeſt, and in that maner to worke your content, I ſhould become cruell againſt my ſelfe: I wil not take any reuenge that may rather redowne to my diſhonour, then honour: But for this time, only I will haue you grant me two things.</p>
               <p>Being all in all yours (replied he) there is no cauſe why by
<pb facs="tcp:13977:11"/>
promiſe you ſhould ſéeke to winne my will, which ſo true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth acknowiedge your ſouerainetie.</p>
               <p>Why then (ſaid ſhe) my firſt demaund is, you giue mee the order of Chiualry and as for my other requeſt you ſhall after know it. I doe (ſayd he) eſteeme my happineſſe farre greater now, then a little afore I eſteemed my ſelfe vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, in that (deare Soueraign of my ſoule) you haue deygned to imploye me, and in affayres more difficult farre, would I haue had you hazarded my life: but ſéeing this is your will, I am content to obaie, and bycauſe I perceaue you want armour, I do beſeech you to accept theſe, which were giuen me for good, and I ſhall be more glad thereof bycauſe they ſhall obtaine a worthier owner. I thanke you for your offer (replied ſhe.) But theſe of <hi>Semyramis</hi> nothing inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to thoſe, I had not long ſince on yonder vallie giuen me, and that with them I ſhould end the greateſt aduenture of the world.</p>
               <p>And ſo caſting off her hunting garments, ſhe diſcouered the rareſt armes that the whole earth could afford, for they were all of Pearles and Dyamonds, with ſuch arte vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it made them farre ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then if they were of fine tempered ſteele: on one ſide they bare a painted harte, but made of ineſtimable orient <hi>Rubies,</hi> whoſe gliſter alyenated the beholders fight, and vntying a ſlender vnder garment, like to a paire of Baſes, ſhe remained the beſt accompliſhed, and in armor the abſoluteſt that could bee deſired. In hys ſight ſhe ſeemed the haughtie Knight of the Sunne, when he withdrew him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Country ruſticke life. Hee gazed on her, with a penſiue admiration, and thought the longeſt time too ſhort for his contemplation, altogether forgetting his promiſe paſt. Well did the Ladye perceaue his amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (for ſhee of no leſſe rare excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie did accompt him) wherewith, a new motion with her little experience learned at that time, ingendred a firme loue with more glories to dignifie her eternitie, but diſſembling her inward paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe put him out of his dumps with theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:11"/>The time Sir knight, begins to ware too late, for you to performe your promiſe. He ſtarted as one ſuddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked from a ſlumber, and with a ſigh replied, your will (<hi>Heroicke</hi> Lady) be accompliſhed: though yet in this the heauens be oppoſed againſt my fortune. And ſo lacing on her helme (that at her ſaddle bowe did hang) whoſe riches doth exceede compare, with the ſword, that vnder one <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie</hi> did once reduce with ſeruile yoak the greateſt parte of the Orbed earth, he ſtruck her a little blowe on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whoſe ſcant heard ſound, put him in ſo cold a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, with feare whether he had ſtrucke too hard. And done, thus ſpake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now (Soueraine Lady) maie you let the world know, that as you are the only <hi>Phoenix</hi> in beautie, ſo you are the ſole <hi>Myrror</hi> in armes. And the ſword guird, with the wondring puritie of your owne hands, for I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend (mauger the ſtrongeſt ſtrength) they be the abſoluteſt on this earth, ſhe ſtraight cloſed the viſor of her helme with admirable gallantneſſe, newe ſnares to intrappe his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue harte, and eſpecially, if any thing elſe were left with libertie. But ſomewhat mooued, ſhe turned her to him thus.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde thing you muſt for me doe, is to take your weapons preſently, for now like a Knight will I reuenge my ſelfe, not like a tender woman, but a rauening Wolfe. Trembling like an Aſpen leafe, with a chill timerous feare ſtood <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> ſéeing her ſo determined in reſolution, &amp; trying whether with milde wordes hee could diſwade her from that reſolution, ſayd. I knowe not what greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you doe pretend (moſt beauteous Lady) then to accept my diſgraced lyfe, which I with ſuch liberalitie doe offer, moſt willingly to diſpoſſeſſe my ſelfe thereof, by your hands, that at one inſtant you may counterpoyze your beauty with your crueltie. I will in nothing (bloody Knight) replyed ſhee) ſo pleaſe you: But you ſhall now féele whom my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath left to take his reuenge, and therefore you haue no more to doe but to put on your armes, for otherwiſe you
<pb facs="tcp:13977:12"/>
ſhall force me to ſome fellonious outrage, killing you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. With Millions of teares did he beſeech her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from her purpoſe, but ſeeing nothing woulde preuaile he buckled on his helme, ſwearing onely to defend himſelfe and not offend her, for rather he would ſuffer himſelfe péece-meale ioynt by ioynt to be torne aſunder. So ſoone as ſhe did ſee him ready, more ſwifter then a hungry Eagle bent to her pray, ſhe flang agaynſt the yeilding youth, and flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing that ſo renowned ſword, ſhe diſcharged ſo furious a blowe vppon his helme, that though through his fine tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it was impenitrable, yet it fell ſo heauie, that his head was forced to receaue it with that humble dutie, which her high ſtate merited, bending both his knees on the earth, with ſuche aſtoniſhment, that ſhee ſeconded another that made the blood guſh through his Viſor. Neuer in all his life did hee feele the valour of one Knight hand to hand ſo greatly to torment him: For neither in the cruell battell with the braue <hi>Teffereo</hi> brother to the King of <hi>Cerdena,</hi> did he receaue any ſuch blowe: nor yet about the libertie of the angry <hi>Garrofilea</hi> Queene of <hi>Tynacria,</hi> was he ſo ouermat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as this Ladie nowe did tyre him. For at his rizing, taking him ſomewhat amazed, ſhee ſtept to him with her left foot foreward, with twoo thruſtes one after another, that he was forced backwardes, and floriſhing her ſworde aloft, ſhee ſtrucke him ſo fierce a blowe on the ſide of his ſhield, that ſhe had almoſt feld him. The Lady, ſeing her enemie would not offend her, burned in kindled coales of inraged fury againſt her loue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered aduerſarie: though more aptly they might be called meſſengers of the winged Lord, ſent with ſo great haſt to demande the Tribute due to his domination, that at ſuch time they ariued, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together they could ſubiugate her will, and diſpoſſeſſe her of her free libertie, that now her Combate was more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row dutie ſhe ought her dead brother, then for any deſire to offend the Knight, that ſo truely ſeemed to be hers.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, ſhe had ſo wearied him, that a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb facs="tcp:13977:12"/>
times he doubted to ſcape wel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> danger. But reſolued rather to die then offer violent hands on whom he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to command his thoughts, &amp; as ſuch a one acknoledging her, vſing his dexteritie, he began to ſhewe himſelfe more nimble, then a light-foot hare purſued by a troope of hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds leaping on al ſides, making the Lady looſe her blows, yet to his no ſmall diſcontent, becauſe he ſuppoſed, he therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed her. Well did the galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Lady perceaue his intent, which was but adding of more fuell to the fier, wherin ſhe burned for him. But returning her eyes on the bloodleſſe carcas of her murthered brother, ſhee ſtrayght forgot all conceaued affection, with the new griefe ſhe receaued, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her redouble her blowes with more fierceneſſe, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that now altogether vnable longer to hould out, hee thought it better at length to cloſe with her, and trie whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by that meanes he might moue her adamantine heart to ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſeration: ſo receauing one blow that made him ſet his hands on the ground, and quickly aryſing, he threw his ſhield a toe-ſide, &amp; running within her, he caſt about her ſholders his amorous &amp; ſtrong arms, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch happy conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, (that he wiſht ſuch ſucceſſe might happen to him, as befell vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Mercury,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the beauteous Nymphs, <hi>Salmacis,</hi> when ſhe imbraced him in the cleare fount of her name whoſe tranſformation of two Natures in one ſhape, was the beginning of <hi>Hermaphrodites</hi> fayned fable) that he might feareleſſe to his content enioy what, fortune then made doubtful, and houlding her, yet not to hard becauſe he would not hurt her, he ſayd.</p>
               <p>Giue not occaſion (moſt valerous Ladye) that it bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoned through the world, how the Mirrour of the newe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of your deuine beautie, is taynted with an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious blot of barbarous crueltie, the onely enemie to thoſe perfections that the almightie carefull <hi>Apelles</hi> of Natures rareſt coulors hath beſtowed on you: For yf my death will aduance your content, I doe receaue it with more anguiſh and paynes, by liuing, to liue pyning awaye in woes, in
<pb facs="tcp:13977:13"/>
your ſeruice. Let it be ſo: for this way ſhall you treade the path that will leade you to a ſatisfied reuenge. Oh ſuffer not (remorceleſſe Lady) that it be ſayd of you, what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of that inhumane and helliſh ſorcereſſe <hi>Medea,</hi> whome with a ſauage deſire of reuenge, moſt cruelly murthered her own children? co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider (oh wonder of admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) it wil ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize the glorie of your excellencies, &amp; you ſhall, (yf you wil do it) offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the rareneſſe of your beautie: for neuer any could boaſt of it, or worthely be nominated beautifull though ſhe excell the brightnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brighteſt Sun, vnleſſe ſhe do aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the crueltie of an hardned hart, the ſole diſhonor of all honor'd Ladies? in ſteed wherof admit the pitie of a mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified breſt, pittie the ſplendor of your name, pittie the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ph of your victorie, pitie the Trophy of your vertues, this, oh let this ſhine through your clouded cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, whoſe beams ſhall ſtellify your chiualries, imortalize your fame, &amp; infuze new life in me, whoſe blod is alredy almoſt vtterly defuſed, vnleſſe your pitie gather it againe, reſtoring it to him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil only kéep, as a memorial ſtatue of this your eternal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt, elſe otherwiſe the vnhappie death of your hapleſſe brother, wil neuer by other means be ſuffitiently reuenged. With ſo many teares, &amp; ſighes did the woefull <hi>Dacian</hi> vtter theſe wordes, that they woulde haue melted a flintie rocke, to diſtilling dropps of water, much more her obduracie, that was aſſured his true loue paſſions forced him to it, and as ſhe had already giuen him the principall commande ouer her will, theſe his new ſpéeches made her thus replie.</p>
               <p>Séeing my ſtarrs, (braue Knight) haue brought mee to ſuch paſſe, that I muſt conſent to what you will, I acquite you of this combate, becauſe I thinke the conqueſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the mighty God of warre hath onely reſeru'd to himſelfe as a particuler honour due to his deitie. Moreouer yf wee ſhould ſtay till my Knights come, there is no doubt but you ſhall incurre ſome great daunger, for the loſſe you haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them by the timeleſſe end of my deare brother, or that I ſhould carrie them the newes, would be no leſſe, then yf
<pb facs="tcp:13977:13"/>
they had ſeene the maner of his pitileſſe death. So I will neyther conſent to the one, nor do the other, but am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to depart in your company, (though it be troubleſom vnto you) vntill by others this infortunate chance be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. So ioyfull became the afflicted Prince w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Ladies words, that like a man ouer-ioyed, he replyed.</p>
               <p>I cannot (moſt excellent Ladie) for ſo high a fauor bind me anew, more then I am already: for ſince my happye deſtinies (though with ſo many aduerſe accidents) brought me to the place where I might enioy your Celeſtiall ſight, I haue no power ouer my will more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obay what euer you ſhal command as the ſole Goddeſſe of my earthly deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hauing to your beheſts for euer vowed deuoted dutie, as a true ſeruitor: And as ſuch a one humbly proſtrated on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lowly earth, I beg I may be accepted, in token of which graunt with like humilitie, I craue that you would deigne to giue me your victorious handes, on whoſe purity I may pay what all the world ſhould doe. She replyed, I would not (ſir Knight) you ſhould ſo ſoone demand the cure of your diſtreſſe: but becauſe you ſhall not altogether deſpaire of my pitie, I wil accompliſh your requeſt, were it onely but to fulfill the firſt commande, intreated by a Knight ſo great an enemie to my content. And ſo ſhee rayſed him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned him as her Knight, giuing him her beauteous handes, which made the gallant <hi>Dacian</hi> thinke, there was no other happineſſe to bee wiſhed in the circled Orbe: and ſéeing himſelfe ſo fauored by that excellent Lady, hee ſayd, Make me at once diuinely happie (diuyne Goddeſſe of my hart) with the diſcouery of the Royall progeny of your So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne ſtocke, and the Kingly parentage of your high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. The ſame (anſwered ſhe) was I determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of you (ſir Knight) but me thinkes you are ſo armed with aſking, that you admit no leaue for my commaunde. Which ſéeing it is ſo, I am content in all things to content you, but firſt let vs from hence, leaſt we be here taken by an elder brother of myne, with whome it cannot be but you
<pb facs="tcp:13977:14"/>
ſhould run into ſome imminent perill, for hee is reputed no leſſe valiant then any of the Greeke Princes, &amp; by the way I will diſcourſe my byrth and parentage: firſt intreating you to direct our courſe to <hi>Grecia,</hi> for I greatly deſire to knowe thoſe Princes ſo highly famozed through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds ſpacious continents, as alſo becauſe I would bee reſolued whether they be your kinſfolkes, for I much ſuſpect it.</p>
               <p>And in great haſt beginning to mount a horſe-back, with farre ſwifter ſpeed, out of the Forreſt, there yſſued the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that was wont to come to the Prince <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> Straight did the <hi>Dacian</hi> Lord know her, to whome with a chereful countenance he thus ſaid: How now deare friend? tell me, haue you any neede of my perſon? Speake: for you know my debt, therefore, I ſhall hazard nothing, if for your ſake, I indaunger my ſelfe. Your loues Sir Knight haue ſo much diſquieted me, as not long ſince I was for your frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d <hi>Toriſmundo:</hi> But becauſe I haue taken part of your griefes, there is no reaſon but you ſhould let me enioy ſome of the glorie and content you haue obtained by the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble bountie of this excellent Lady, whoſe beautie farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth her, for whoſe ſake <hi>Troy</hi> was ſubuerted. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your departure cannot be excuſed, my Vncle <hi>Lirgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo</hi> ſends you this ſhield, that you may preſent it to this Lady, that in ſuch great danger did put your valour, giuing her new armes, that ſhee may altogether conquer you. This ſaid, ſhe drew foorth a ſhield of the like colour of the armour, with ſo many precious ſtones, that it well denoted the workmanſhip of ſo rare a workman, it had the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe that <hi>Don Elenos</hi> had, which was a <hi>Cupid</hi> with two faces: for in that he greatly delighted, ſaying: that both in peace and warre, it was iuſt to acknowledge him the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that ouer all things he claimes. And to you (braue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) he bid me ſaie, you ſhould not a little accompt of this Knight: for it were life to manie to ſee him as you now doe: and of your brother, he wils you to looſe your care, leauing it onely to him, for he hath it, and will hereafter, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:13977:14"/>
regard al your affairs as his own. She awaited no anſwer, but with the turning of her Palfrey, ſhe made the Forreſt make ſo great a noyſe, as if it had ben ouerwhelmed. They looking what it might be, ſaw at the foote of a tree a rich tombe, admirable for curious works, and ſo tranſparant, that the Princes running to it, they ſaw the Ladies bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he fell with the cruell wound, with certaine redd letters, which the Prince thus read:
<q>Here ſhall the wounded <hi>Larſino</hi> abide, vntill his cruell mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer ſhall make ſatisfaction with his proper life, ſatisfying thoſe two that deareſt in the world did loue.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They could not conceaue the meaning of thoſe wordes, though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he remained inchaunted, ſomewhat comforted them, and ſeeing it waxed late, the Lady ſaid: Let vs go (Sir Knight,) for I beleeue I ſhall one day ſee what I haue thought impoſſible: for as I thinke, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaineth in this inchauntment. So they began to take their way toward the Sea coaſt. When the valiant <hi>Aſtorildo</hi> the Ladies eldeſt brother, ſeeing ſhee was not to be found, and finding his brother inchaunted, cauſed all his Knights to returne home, commaunding them to tell his Father, he was gon to ſeeke his ſiſter, and taking with him but one Squire, he ſhipt himſelfe towards <hi>Graecia,</hi> in which voyage we leaue him, returning to the aduentures that happened the new Louers.</p>

Arryuing at the ſhore, he ſtraight lept from his horſe, holding the ſtyrrop that his Lady might do the like: but not admitting it, with a ſmyle (alighting by the other ſide) ſhee ſaid, you ſhall not thinke (Sir Knight) with ſo ſmall a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to ſatiſfie the great wrong you haue done me, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, they ſtaied til <hi>Fabio</hi> had ſhipt their horſes, the gladdeſt man aliue, to ſée what good Fortune had happened to his Lord and maiſter, becauſe he thought her beautie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all compare, wherein he nothing did deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For in deede the world contained fewe like vnto her.

For ſhe thought that Knight was he to whome her beautie was due: and he that her merits deſerued his true faith, till death, ſacrifized with the fire of her valour. But to breake off eithers ſilent imaginations, he began: Now is the time (diuine Ladie) ſeing the Heauens and the Seas inuite vs with their calme quietneſſe) that you would tell me whom
<pb facs="tcp:13977:15"/>
I muſt acknowledge, for the ſoueraigne Princeſſe of my ſoule, paying the awfull fealtie of my due tribute, as a true liege man to his ſworne Prince. I will not haue you thinke (Sir Knight) that with your great praiſing of my ſmal beauty, you do pay me the much good that I wiſh you. And becauſe in all things I will haue you know, that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do commit greater ſinne in being pittifull, then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing auſtere in denying the requeſtes of their amorous gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, I will ſatiſfie your demaund.

               <p>We came, my brothers and I a hunting to this Foreſt, (called of the faire Fountaine,) and parting from them in purſute of that Hart, on the toppe of a mountaine, on the ſudden a beauteous Lady ſet her ſelfe before me, crying, ſtay: for without armour, you cannot well paſſe forwards: and vnbynding a little packet ſhee there had, ſhee gaue me this armour, ſaying they were them wherewith <hi>Semyramis</hi> did winne <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that with them I ſhould ouercome

               <p>Magnificent Princeſſe (replyed the <hi>Dacian</hi>) my ſoule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth to ſatiſfie your requeſt, becauſe you may know I am he that with moſt faith do procure onely firmely euer to obey you, although I would not to you manifeſt the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of my lowe Fortunes. Notwithſtanding, know my name is <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> Nephew to the Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the onely ſonne of his ſole brother. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, no leſſe ſignes haue befell me in the courſe of my life, then to you, that I ſhould come to this you haue ſaide: For winning this armour in <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing my hart as free as now captiue, a wiſe man, my deare friend, commanded mee to depart thence, without ſpeaking to any woman vntill I ſhould yeeld the Soueraigne commaund ouer me, vnto the greateſt Feminine enemie that in the whole earth I might procure: for therein conſiſted the only quiet of my felicitie: wherein I thinke the wiſeman hath not erred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſayings haue bene accompliſhed to the full: For maugre the libertie of my hart, and the content I ioyed therewith, togither with all my former ſucceſſes through your meanes, the happie ſight of your firſt approch, ſo alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated my ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſelfe, that I was faine to ſubmit my ſoule to hope ſome redreſſe for ſo great a change, and yet thereby looſing the ſame hope of remedie through the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie death of your deare brother, though now I haue not altogether loſt if of his life, becauſe that learned man that ſent vs this ſhield, hath vndertaken the care of his ſafetie.
<pb facs="tcp:13977:16"/>
But becauſe I am and will be yours, vntill the fatall Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of life and death ſhall abridge my ſoule of her breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifices. I beſeech you by the firmeneſſe of our ſincere loue, you will aſſure my hopes, confirme my deſires, and ſet an end to my painfull longings.</p>
               <p>With the end of which wordes with more boldneſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his feare required, he kiſt her on the chéeke, which done, he dyed his own, with ſuch a baſhfull tincture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it altogether ſtopt the paſſage of his ſpéech. Well did the Lady perceaue his alteration, who with ſome ſhowe of anger replyed. I would not (Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi>) that the committing of my honours puritie, and my Maydens fame into your hands, ſhould be occaſion of your little regard vnto the great reſpect due to the confidence I haue in you repoſed: wherein yf you neglect the dutie you owe thereto, I will rather caſt my ſelfe into theſe deuouring waters, then the glorie of my chaſt thoughts ſhall endure any ſtayne. And the receauing you for my Knight hath not been ſo ſmal a fauor, but might ſufficiently ſo content you: that my kéeping you company, &amp; thus alone to truſt you, with my immaculate, &amp; vnſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned imaginations, ſhould be no cauſe to mooue you to this diſcourteſie. And offering to goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hatches, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince with Millions of ſighes proceeding from his ſoule, ſtayed her by the arme with theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>That I haue diſpleaſed you (Imperious Princeſſe) ſo torments me, that I know not how to ſatisfie your diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent conceaued, vnleſſe you now will take a full reuenge, for my many trangreſſions, though it bee with effuſion of my deareſt, deareſt lyfe: and yet what I did was forced by the motion of a pure ſincere loue, and not of any laſciuious thoughts. So aſſured was the beauteous <hi>Roſamond</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that ſhe thus made anſwere.</p>
               <p>Since my happie ſtarrs (braue Prince) haue put me in your hands, they haue dryuen me to that neceſſitie, that I muſt forget and forgiue any offence whatſoeuer: but if you ſhall paſſe theſe lymits, my ſelfe will execute on my owne
<pb facs="tcp:13977:17"/>
life the cruelleſt death ere heard of. With incredidle ioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> amorous Prince, kiſt her hands for the fauor, &amp; being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the paleneſſe of <hi>Cinthias</hi> ſhine, that it was time to withdrawe themſelues, they returned to their ſeuerall cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, comparable to any <hi>Monarches</hi> chamber: where they paſt the night with ſuch conformable thoughts, that hadd they durſt either to viſite the other at that ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whether they would haue differred the glory attending on ſuch attempts.</p>
               <p>A little before the Meſſenger of morne began to lace the Heauens with her goulden hayre, the Princely youth, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe ſo true a ſeruitor vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God of loue, &amp; ſo dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be loued, rayſed himſelfe on the bed and leauing on his pillowe, tooke his Lute in hand, and making it ſound the repetition of his ioyes, he ſung the felicitie that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens gaue him in the poſſeſſion of ſo rare a Lady: in theſe verſes.</p>

Well did the Princeſſe heare him, ouer-ioyed
<pb facs="tcp:13977:17"/>
to be loued by ſo braue a Prince, imagening ſhe could not hope for more, hauing ſo great a good there preſent. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſhe determined yet to diſſemble her affection, vntill the time did counſell her what ſhe ſhould doe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sunne had begun his ryſing in the Eaſt, ſhe made her ready, putting on her white &amp; moſt rich armour, &amp; went directly to the Princes cabbyn, who with his new care, had it not, to clothe himſelf, yet ſeing his Lady come, he woulde riſe, but ſhe ſtaying him ſayd, I would haue had you done it afore (Sir Knight) for he that liues ſo careleſſe, ſhould not belike doubt of his Miſtres fauors, and with my ſoule I would be glad to know her, that I might aſke her if ſhe ioyes in ſo careleſſe a louer. Deuineſt Princeſſe, (replyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince) with nothing doe I more expreſſe my poore ſoules penſiueneſſe, then with ſuch careleſnes, which being well noted, it will be iudged a carefull confidence, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more ſéene, nor better deſerued in any, then in whome true loue hath rooted his conceipts, for without care of anye thing elſe, he doth onely buſie himſelfe, in the ſwéete imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his owne alienation.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding (anſwered the Lady) I doe condemne ſo great confidence almoſt grounded vpon an extremitie, and in moſt reſpcts, little reſpecting the Lady loued, for the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ielous louer did neuer, but die, confounded in his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. A care magnanimous and honorable, is to be alow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excuſed, and worthy of eſtimation, but vtterly to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-whelmed in penſiue ſuſpence, and make you ſéeme no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a louer, befits you not, nor yet becoms it one bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, to accompliſh ſo many things as you.</p>
               <p>I doe ioy ſo much (deare Miſtres of my hart) to loue and wholy to employ my ſelfe therein, that I would ſhewe no ſigne that I can any thing otherwiſe, and although I ſhould doe ſo, I do not requite the worth of my imployment, for if I had a Thouſand ſoules, al were to few, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> content of my imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s where al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good is decyphered, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I might expect, and I finde that being not this waye,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:18"/>
yf would be more then troubleſome. Sir Knight (replyed ſhe) you doe ſo highly accompt the thing loued, that I doe wiſh I were ſhe, to obtaine that glorie that neuer <hi>Venus</hi> did enioy, though in beautie a Goddeſſe, and it ſhould be for no longer then I might knowe, whether it be true all that you publiſh. Thereof (excellent Princeſſe replied he,) craue no better teſtimonfe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paine that I conceaued with your ſight. Then (anſwered ſhee) you cannot denie mee, that to loue, is more to feare, then any other thing, ſeeing you ſay, that the firſt ſight left you ſo wounded: whereby I inferre, your paine proceeded of your ſight. All that you haue ſaide (braue Ladie, anſwered he) is armour to defend my cauſe, ſeing none could neuer loue, vnleſſe he liued with feare: for he that doth not feare his loſſe with thouſand ſighes and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, is to make the world knowe, he is not trulie eſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe ielouſie is the aboundance of the ſoule that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, &amp; with that he feares to looſe the obiect loued. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhe anſwered, In all things will you remaine ſole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour (<hi>Heroyke</hi> Prince) and herein will I witnes your true fayth, making it knowne vnto your Lady, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto ſhe may reward you with fauors, or diſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors, and for the firſt there is no reaſon they ſhould be ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on any that leſſe loueth then you.</p>
               <p>If (deare Lady of my life ſayd hee) I might liue aſſured thereof, who like me ſhould tryumph ouer Fortune? whoe ſhould force ſtrength out of a drooping heart to loue, but I? or who would feare a tempeſtuous ſtorme, hauing the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſo ſwéete a calme? That, and what elſe you will braue Prince (ſayd ſhe) is in your hands quietly to poſſeſſe, onely admitting no new change, for if you doe, you ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no wronge, to be depriued of the fauors, that your loue deſerueth. But make you ready for I perceaue a well ryg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſhippe make towards vs, and I will in the meane while goe knowe who it is. Lyke to a nimble Deare leapt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant youth out of his bed, extreame ioyed of his Ladies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and with his Squiers helpe hee armed him with the
<pb facs="tcp:13977:18"/>
moſt rich armour of the great Romaine <hi>Brutus,</hi> and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the hatches, where his Ladie did expect him, with a low amorous congie, he ſaid to her. Happie is the Knight, that (immerited) hath obtained who with ſuch care ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the faultes of my careleſneſſe. It hath not been ſo little (ſaide ſhee) but it might need all: and looke yonder, for I thinke I ſee a Tower built vpon the Sea, vnleſſe her byg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe deceaue me. Their barke quickly ioyned to it, that they well perceaued it was as the Lady ſayd. So ſoone as they aryued to the foot thereof, (for it was the ſame, where <hi>Roſabell</hi> was inchaunted,) they ſaw certaine greene Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald letters, to this effect.</p>
               <q>No leſſe courage and valour then good Fortune requireth the entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the marueilous Tower: for regarding what is in it, demanding this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required. For firſt the vniustly loued of the two Sisters, ſhall looſe his fortunute armour, ere ſo much as hope be got, to liberate from hence the treaſure of Niquea.</q>
               <p>Long did the two Louers ſtand gueſſing to vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> darke inſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, purpoſing to try the aduenture, euen at the time that to them ariued in another barke two Knights, of no leſſe diſpoſition then any they euer ſawe, attyred wyth moſt rich abillements of warre, who no leſſe admired their gallantnes, and hauing their viſors open and ſhewing their deuine faces, yet they coulde not imagine who ſo braue Knights ſhould be. They that aryued after a ſolemne cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie ſayd, ſir Knights, we greatly deſire to know, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture this is, and the maner how we might proue it. It is ſo little ſince we aryued, (replyed the loued <hi>Dacian</hi>) that we cannot certifie you of any thinge. For if we had knowen how to haue entred it, we had not ſtayed for you. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb facs="tcp:13977:19"/>
abaſhed were the newe commers, and he that read the Inſcription, thus ſpake. Vnleſſe I be deceaued Knights co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the conditions demanded, although you had founde meanes to proue it, it would be too difficult for you. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſo much as it doth (anſweared the <hi>Dacian</hi>) though more troubleſome, we had tried it: for without a thinge be proued, it cannot be called difficult. But you that ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence doe repoſe in your valour, tell me in how many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haue you hazarded your perſon, for a man that feares, is an euident ſigne, he hath been in ſome action, whoſe end ſhould ſéeme to haue béen difficult, although heere a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope doth leſſen any feare, and therefore doe deſire that I and you might trie our Fortunes in this attempt.</p>
               <p>That were (anſwered the Knight) for you to expect, and receaue helpe and ayde from my arme, if you needed, the <hi>Dacian</hi> was not of ſuch patience, &amp; therefore his raſhneſſe was condemned) as to ſuffer ſo broade ataunt, and ſo repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Truly (Knight) I neuer thought that the offering you my perſon ſhould haue moued you to ſuch preſumption: But prepare your ſelfe, for I will ſhew you I haue no néede of your helpe. Wherewith he cloſed his Beuer, and drew foorth his ſword, finding his aduerſarie in no leſſe readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being no leſſe then the gallant <hi>Don Argante</hi> of <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicia,</hi> and his companion was the valiant <hi>Toriſiano,</hi> whoe hauing ſet from the defended Iland, were driuen thither by the tempeſtuous waues, and with his armour and valour, did imagine quickly to terminate that buſines. But he met with him that admits no compariſon but with the Grecian Péeres, who with the murthering ſword of <hi>Brutus,</hi> with a floriſh in his firſt aſſault, kept it aloft till hee ſpyed occaſion which offered (no knight like he could neuer with more ſpéed or in time better take it) he croſt his good ſword, and ſetling himſelfe for the blow, vnderneath his ſhield he layd it on ſo fiercely, that he forſt his aduerſary to ſtaggar thrée or foure ſtepts backward. He had ſcarce executed this blowe, when with an Eagles ſwiftnes, he leapt into his boate, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
<pb facs="tcp:13977:19"/>
him with his ſhield in his entrance ſo ſtrongly, that ouerbearing him a little of one ſide he had quite ouerthrown him.</p>
               <p>There wanted none with ſhrill voyces to ſolemnize the valour of the <hi>Ruſſet</hi> Knight: for with the opening of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine windowes on the toppe of the Tower, the Heauens ſéemed to vnlocke their caſements, ſetting their Celeſtiall dwellers to the view: for all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being the Princeſſe <hi>Lyriana</hi> &amp; her Couzens, ſetled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to behold the battle, for onely this libertie hadd they to recreate themſelues, although they were not ſuffred to know any, becauſe of their great griefe, they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue by the ſight of ſome, not enioying their louers company, for ſo did the <hi>Magician</hi> order that made that inchantment. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was the braue <hi>Phenician</hi> amazed to ſée his aduerſarye in his barke, but reioyced, becauſe he thought, hee might ſo better make his battle. And with this, as alſo with ſéeing ſuch beauteous Ladies did behold their fight, he turned vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his enemie, and with his <hi>Tellamonian</hi> blade, diſcharged ſo braue a blow vpon his head, that it made him bende hys knées, in recompence of his bould entrance. Nymble was the youth and ſo would ſecond another, but the <hi>Dacian</hi> fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated it with his celeritie: for with a thruſt, he forced him backe with as much ſpéede as euer he came. And ſo at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth ſetling themſelues firmely on their féete, they began the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt combate that euer was fought vpon thoſe Seas: for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to penetrate their ſure armes, all the force of their fight conſiſted on their valour, and nimblenes, which was their ſole auaile. Not a little did the gallant <hi>Roſamond</hi> grieue to ſee her deare Prince in the battaile, not for the daunger thereof: for ſhe well ſawe the aduantage he had ouer his enemie: but the true louer doth onely waigh the preſent ill of the thing loued, admitting no entrance to the hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny future good. So reſolued to accompany him in al things cloaſing her Beuer with the beſt ſword that the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſhe went towards <hi>Toriſiano</hi> with theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:20"/>It ill beſeemes vs, to ſee our friends in ſuch egar warre, and our ſelues in peace. Neuer did the gallant youth ſee a more accompliſhed Knight then the Lady did repreſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed: for which in many places ſhee was reputed to be <hi>Claridiano.</hi> Notwithſtanding, accepting the combate, (for with <hi>Ioue</hi> he would not haue refuſed it) he began to prepare himſelfe. Eaſely did the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, heare the ſweete name of friend: which augmented ſuch courage in his amorous breſt, that he began with freſh ſtrength to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch, him ſelfe receiuing mightie blowes, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die clearely ſaw his aduantage. But quickly were they put from this, turning to gaze vpon the Knight with the white armour, on whome his excellent diſpoſition, did drawe their affection. This was our Knightly Lady, that meeting with her enemie togither, they laide on each other ſo puiſſant blowes, that with their hands they were faine to ſuſtaine themſelues. Of greater ſtrength was the Lady, for which cauſe ſhee roſe ſooneſt, and with her good ſword ſhee gaue him ſuch a blowe on the Helme, that ſhee made him ſee mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſtarres: ſhee ſeconded it ſomewhat lower, which had it bene in the ſame place, he could not but haue incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mightie danger, yet made ſhe the blood flye through his eyes, and noſtrels, which was but making the youth more furious, who going towards her, ſeemed to awaight her ſtroke which ſhee with eagerneſſe to beſtowe, regarded not his intent. For in the diſcharge, he ſtept to his left ſide, fuſtrating her blowe, at which time, hauing opportunitie: for taking her without ſhield there, vnder her right arme, he ſtrucke with ſuch ſtrength, that the Lady greatly felt the waight of her aduerſe ſword: for it made her giue backe with ſuch a ſtagger, that ſhee had almoſt fell ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board. And the haughtie <hi>Toriſiano</hi> ſeeing her amaze, would haue lept after her: but ſhe returned with ſuch ſpeede, that ſhe incountred him in his leaping, and ſo thruſt him, that it was an admirable wonder, how he fell not in the Sea (yet he fell with a ſore fall in the middle of his Barke. Gladly
<pb facs="tcp:13977:20"/>
would the Lady haue done what her Lord did, but ſhee thought it would onely hinder him, becauſe the ſhippe was little. So ſhe ſtayed for his comming, who returned like a rauenous Tyger, renuing ſo fiercely their fight, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of an hundred Knightes together, ſo great was their noyſe. For the Lady reputed it to be diſhonour to her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that her aduerſary ſhould indure ſo long againſt her, ſpecially in her Princes ſight, that being her firſt battaile. With like immagination was her enemie troubled, and ſo agreeing in one deſire, diſcharged on each other the mightie ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of their furious armes, with ſuch puiſance, that the Eccho of their ſounding blowes, made the valleyes in the firme land many myles off ſéeme to tremble with the ſhrill noyze. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of the blow, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> royall Lady loſt her Helme couering her white armour, with thouſand treſſed tramels of hairie gold, reſting with ſome alteration, through a litle blood that iſſued from her mouth. But hers in a more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſort had put the gallant <hi>Toriſiano,</hi> for with a great fall with blood burſting through his eyes, ſhe tumbled him at the enemies feete of her deare Knight, who at the noyſe, with more care then the Princely Eagle gardeth her yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, turned about, and ſeeing his ſoules life, in that amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without Helme, thought her to be ſore wounded, that with a rigorous blowe, driuing his enemie from him, with a leape he returned to his owne ſhippe, to know what danger ſhe was in. With great applauſe was this care of <hi>Don Eleno</hi> celebrated by the towred Ladies, highly eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the doubtfull regard he ſhewed of his Ladie. Well did the louers heare it, &amp; ſo ſhe receiued him with theſe wordes. It is no time now (braue Prince) to loſe, what with ſo much blood you haue wonne. And ſeeing my daunger hath bene the cauſe thereof, I will put on no Helme, vntill my arme hath againe aſſured you what you vallour had obtained. So ending her ſpeech, more nimbler then an Ounce, ſhee lept into her aduerſaries ſhipp, at what time they had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them ſelues, with more furie then angry Lyons hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:13977:21"/>
by their foes. Betweene them, feareleſſe of her head, did the Lady caſt her ſelfe, &amp; in her entrance meeting firſt with <hi>Don Argante,</hi> vpon his ſhoulder ſhee grounded the waight of her furious rage, whoſe paine was ſo extreame, that he thought that ſide was opened to his middle, and reaching <hi>Toriſiano</hi> with a thruſt, ſhe made his ſhield ioyne with his breſt, and himſelfe almoſt looſe his breath.</p>
               <p>But this time was the inraged <hi>Dacian</hi> entred the barke floriſhing his rich ſword, whereby they could not but incur great perrill: had not the moſt beauteous Princeſſe of <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quea</hi> foreſéen it, who much pittying the twoo companions, thus ſpake.</p>
               <p>So admirable is the loſſe that this ſpacious Orbe will receiue, with any of your deathes (valiant and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Knights) that it conſtraynes me to entreate you (yf in you there be ſo much courteſie as courage) for this time to giue ouer this combate, for which theſe Ladies and I will worthely extoll your bounties. The Princeſſe <hi>Roſamond</hi> enuious of ſo rich a ſight, quickly thus replyed: firſt admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Lady, yt doth ſo aduance the honor of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring knights, that none can be more greater, then to obay the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſeruice of all Ladies, inſomuch that they accompt it a deuine felicitie, to haue ſuch occaſions to ſhew it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, that for the incredidle deſire, &amp; inexplicable wil I haue to ſerue them, I doe on my behalfe giue ouer the fight, not onely for this tyme but for euer, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight doth leaue ſo waued (to my coſt) by this, that I thinke it beſt to craue an aſſurance againſt all future accidents. All the Princes greatly ſmyled at her ſpéech, becauſe they knew her to bee a woman by her hayre, when ſhee loſt her helme, whereupon <hi>Lyriano</hi> replyed. Brauely haue you defended your beauty (moſt valerous Ladye) bynding thereby all Knights to your perpetuall ſeruice. And wee wiſh wee were them, that you might know, if we can intreate, it is becauſe we onely indeuored to be your dutyfull ſeruitors. Notwithſtanding we hope, and ſo I doe beléeue, there is no
<pb facs="tcp:13977:21"/>
Knight but will do it, ſoly to pleaſure you, &amp; to obtaine your fauour, though our intreaties ceaſſed in that caſe. With no leſſe courteſie then valour were the Princes indewed, and ſo the <hi>Phenician</hi> replyed when on our ſide the victorie were moſt ſure (deuine Ladies) we would leaue it to gaine ſome part of your fauours: much more, being conſtrained to looſe by this, what by the other we obtained. Neuertheleſſe, my companion and I, are contented to obey you, yeelding the trophie of the conqueſt to theſe triumphing Knights. Yours is the victorie (Heroike warriors) aunſwered the <hi>Dacian,</hi> not onely of this battaile, but of all honour in the vniuerſe. Hereupon they imbraced one another, crauing pardon of their laſt attempt, and ſo the Princes returned to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted Barke: which no ſooner had they entred, when ſwifter then an arrowe ſhot from a ſteeled bowe, it depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the inchaunted Tower, leauing the beholders ſo amazed, that they could not beliue it, looſing their ſight whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they entred the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea, ſhaping their courſe towardes <hi>Lguria:</hi> what there befell them, in the next Chapter ſhall be related.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O many, and ſo certaine are the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that happens to an amorous louer, ſo great his croſſes, and ſo ſure his miſaduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that if amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g millions of miſfortunes he obtaines one good Fortune, he may iuſtly ſay, it happened by chaunce, and ſo lawfully may it be accompted a miracle, eſteeming it of no leſſe rarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then the <hi>Phaenix,</hi> whoſe nature neuer admitted any plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, which being ſo, with reaſon ſhould all men reioyce at anothers happineſſe therein, becauſe it is a deſerued

merite after ſo many paines. This thus conſidered, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with ioy exult, when I ſee another by his miſtreſſe fauoured, and much more, if he obtaine the glorious end of his wiſhes, which gladneſſe, hath poſſeſt mee with ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein a pleaſure, that I haue purpoſed to follow the <hi>Dacian</hi> Prince, who now among <hi>Venus</hi> chiefeſt fauourits may be named, and of them the happieſt, becauſe beloued of <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> And in ſo much that for the leaſt hope of her deare fauours, <hi>Apollo</hi> willingly would haue changed his eternal deitie for his decaying mortalitie. With her did <hi>Don Eleno</hi> merily diſcourſe, and amongeſt other chat, demaunded her how ſhe felt her ſelfe of the laſt combate, with her ſtrong ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie? How could I but do well (replyed ſhe) and be better (braue Prince) hauing on my ſide the valour of the <hi>Dacian</hi> Lord. That were (deare Lady, ſaid ſhe) becauſe it was done in company of your Fortitude, whence redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the courage for greater aduentures? I wil not ſo ſoone (anſwered ſhe) purpoſe to beleeue it ſo, till once againe (for nothing) you looſe what your valour got. For it argues no leſſe Fortitude to maintaine it, then to regaine it. And in my ſoule I would reioyce to knowe what thoſe Ladies be, that in the Tower do remaine. For in my iudgemrnt, the beautie ſo greatly eſteemed through the world, and ſo rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured elſewhere, is but the ſhadow of that ſubſtance wee left incloſed there. And neuer beleeue mee, but their libertie will dearely coſt, to him ſhall concerne, becauſe the trophie of their gained honour, will counteruaile the greateſt toyle. And no little pleaſure ſhould I alſo conceaue with the knowledge of thoſe Knights, who ſurely cannot but be of high diſcent, conſidering with what courteſie they left the combate. Who is he that dares longer maintaine it (ſaid he) the Princeſſe of <hi>Callidonia</hi> being his enimie, if he will feare to diſpleaſe her, ſeeing they that liue in peace, (becauſe they will not do it) alſo tremble at her name.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo (replyed ſhee) the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> neede not feare my armes. If my Fortune (aunſwered the Prince)
<pb facs="tcp:13977:22"/>
had giuen me that good that yet ſhe hath not, I needed not then expect greater hopes? and therefore ſhee doth reſerue this happineſſe, that he may ſtill be crauing, that liueth with ſuch feare. All that ſhal little auaile you (replyed the Ladie) to defend you from mine anger, if once you fall into it. Ay me (ſaide the amorous youth with a ſigh, a newe ſnare to intrap the captiue Ladie) how well can my ſoule auerre it, ſince that little inſtant that my life was prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to hope a perpetuall eternitie. I would not Sir Knight (faid ſhe) you ſhould ſo ſoone aſſure your ſelfe to liue in my fauour, were it onely, becauſe you are ſo reputed by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the inchaunted Tower, and ſo I will diſſemble my former anger.</p>
               <p>Thus went the loued youth, enioying of theſe fauours, when one morning when <hi>Aurora</hi> firſt ſhewed the brigthnes of her face, armed with their riche armes, they entred the broade cleare riuer <hi>Achelous</hi> that deriues his name from <hi>Tethis</hi> famous ſonne, that combated with <hi>Hercules</hi> about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maraiage of <hi>Deianira</hi> daughter to <hi>Oneio</hi> King of <hi>Etolea</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the warrelike <hi>Theban,</hi> by diſpoſſeſſing him of his life, gaue that riuer his name, which he chriſtened with his blood. Within ſight had they the mountaine <hi>Pindus,</hi> whence it ſpringes. And had they knowne what there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell vnto their anceſtors, there is no doubte but with more delight they had gazd on it, &amp; with more pleaſure pondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his hight, But w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtream, through the currrent of the riuer, they were driusu with ſuch velocitie, that within three daies they entred the <hi>Italian</hi> ſeas, &amp; in the fourth, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting along the <hi>Tuſcane</hi> land, cutting twixt <hi>Vero,</hi> and <hi>Macra,</hi> two mighty riuers proud of their ſtreams, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> when the <hi>Sunne</hi> mounted on the higheſt promontory toppes, they ranne aland in <hi>Moneco,</hi> the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> port of <hi>Liguria</hi> now called <hi>Ienua</hi>) not farre from the populous <hi>Cittie Sauona,</hi> wher then the courte laie.</p>
               <p>With great content landed the two valiant louers, with the only companie of <hi>Fabio,</hi> and leauing the charge of their
<pb facs="tcp:13977:23"/>
Barke to him that guided it, they tooke the broadeſt tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den path they could finde, becauſe they woulde the ſooner meete with whom might tell them the land they iournied in. They trauailed with their armour for that they tooke moſt felicitie therein. In this manner went they in ſweet chatt. (for none is like to that of two, if they intirely loue) til it was towards noone: at which time they ſpied a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell come towards them as faſt as her palfrey could runne, crying aloud after ſhe ſaw them. Hay me (Sir Knights) now is the time, that you muſt make knowen the valour of your parſons, by redreſſing the greateſt diſgrace that might befall. And if you be determined to returne with me, by the way I will tell it you. We are content faire damozell (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Prince) to accompliſh what you will, hauing for ſuch purpoſes, receiued the order of Knighthood. So ſhee turned her palfray, they all ſet forwardes in great haſte, while the damozel thus ſaid: you now (Sir Knights) are within the kingdome of <hi>Lyguria,</hi> nigh the citie of <hi>Sauona,</hi> where the King keepeth his Court. And becauſe this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is ſo freſh, temperate and pleaſant, the Princeſſe <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyna</hi> walked abroad this morning vnto this Wood to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create her ſelfe with other Ladyes, not farre from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Hercules:</hi> and ſitting all together about a pleaſant Fountaine, from one ſide of a groue there iſſued a moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage monſter, like vnto a bigge horſe, and hurting none of vs, through a ſudden trance that ſurprized vs, he had time to carrie away all the Ladies two by two, and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them the Princeſſe, except me and two other, that are gone to beare theſe heauie newes vnto the citie.</p>
               <p>Conſider (Sir Knights) my diſtreſſe, &amp; whether I haue not reaſon to bewaile it. You haue it (faire Lady, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Roſamond</hi>) and ſo great, that it had moued mee to ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion (that ſetting aſide the duetie that al Knights are bound to, in procuring her libertie,) I do here offer my perſon to raunſome her from bondage, promiſing to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt therein. Shee vttred it ſo quickly, that the Prince
<pb facs="tcp:13977:23"/>
could not ſhowe his willingneſſe in that caſe. Yet did he hope that his Lady would commaund it him. Within ſhort time they arriued at the Temple, which in their ſights ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no leſſe gorgious then any they euer ſawe. For the ſtones ſo ſhined, that they ſeemed of burniſht golde: and ſo many Pyramides it had, that the view thereof rauiſhed the ſenſes with pleaſure. So ſoone as the damzell ſaw it, with teares ſhe ſaid: That (Sir Knights) is the place that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors him that ſtole the Princeſſe my Miſtreſſe and her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In a tryce diſmounted the two gallant louers, and leauing their horſes to <hi>Fabio,</hi> with their naked ſwords they went to the Temple, which was with brazen barred gates faſt ſhut, on whome they read this inſcription.</p>
               <q>The entrance ef the auncient Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but to one: Firſt ſwearing, that he loueth, and with a faith inuyolate, for a houſe ſo amorous as this, may not be allowed to any, but ſuch a one.</q>
               <p>Forwards ſtept the Lady, with whome nothing preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Princes intreaties, to make her leaue that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterpriſe, but ſwearing what the entrance requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that ſo loud, that the Prince might heare, it ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced him, that his ſenſes with pleaſure were bereft him: For before ſhee knockt, ſhe ſaid: If my being in loue, may any thing auaile, then will I not looſe what my conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie aſſures. For I vow by my high thoughts, that I liue by onely being ſo, enuying none therein, becauſe I beleue I am the beſt beſtowed of any that euer loued, ſince it was knowen what loue did meane. And ſo with a ſeld ſeene gallantneſſe (able to intrap the God of Loue) ſhee rapt at the gates, which were opened with no leſſe noiſe, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Theſeus</hi> was entertained in hell, bent to the rape of faire <hi>Proſerpine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She could perceiue nothing about the gates but flames of fire, to defend them, whoſe timerous ſight, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:13977:24"/>
to affright the ſtouteſt hart. But ſhee that was borne to liue without it (vnleſſe it proceeded from a true loue) entred wiihout feare of the fire. Where not a little did ſhe trye the vertue of het <hi>Babylonian</hi> armes, whoſe ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtones did mittigate that heat. Neuertheleſſe, that which entred through her Beuer, was ſo extreame, that it almoſt ſmoothered her. Yet valiantly ſuffering it, with much toyle ſhee paſſed forward, till ſhee came before an Altar, whereon they vſed to ſacrifice to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that, ſhee went into a large yard, (free of the flames) though not of the diſcontent ſhee conceiued, when there ſhee ſawe vpon the tarras of the ſame many Ladies lamentably bewailing ouer a Knight, that ſhee ſuppoſed to be her deare <hi>Dacian,</hi> who by foure was carried on a Hearſe, pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with many woundes) ſaying, O poore Prince, how quickly haue the Fates conſpired the ouerthrowe of thy content, with ſo cruell death: and turning to the Lady that in the yarde ſtoode dead with griefe, they ſaide: What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth thée Princeſſe of <hi>Callidonia,</hi> to haue proteſted thou thou didſt loue, if ſo ſoone thou ſhouldeſt looſe thy louer? They gaue her no time to demaund the cauſe and manner of that ſight. For from a corner of the yarde, there iſſued a moſt fierce <hi>Centaure,,</hi> bigger then the greateſt horſe, who knowing her, ſwifter then the Winde, made towardes the Ladie with theſe wordes:</p>
               <p>Stay captiue wretch, and ſtraight thou ſhalt knowe the gaines of thy preſumption, hauing vndertaken this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe (accompting it an honorable act) that <hi>Ioues</hi>-borne <hi>Hercules</hi> my greateſt foe durſt neuer imagine. In his courſe, he was an Eagle, and ſo incountred her ſo mightily with his hayrie breſt, that with a grieuous fall he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw her on her backe. Returne vpon her he deſired, but the furie that conducted him, ſo farre did lead him, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he turned, the Lady was alreadie on her feete. But here was ſhe in the hands of death. For the ſauage monſter brought with him foure mightie trees, which he threwe in
<pb facs="tcp:13977:24"/>
ſteede of darts, whoſe force, were able topſiturnie to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe a well built edificie. The Ladie was driuen to open her viſar, the better to ſee how to defend herſelfe from the vnequall fight, wherein ſhee did nothing amiſſe. For the furious <hi>Centaure,</hi> taking one, with ſuch puiſance like to a ſmall darte he hurled it. Her nimbleneſſe ſaued her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, which lighting on a ſtone of the wall in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yard, it ranne vp to the middle, ouerthrowing a great peece thereof. So ſpeedie was he in throwing, that though ſhee freed her ſelfe of the ſecond: yet the thirde tooke her on the ſyde of her ſhield, that it turned her three or foure times about, that ſhe was like to fall, and ſo in this amaze he ſtruck her on the Helme with the laſt, that he laide her on the earth, voiding much blood through her mouth and noſtrels. And herein is ſhee not to be blamed: for the whole ſtrength of all the Grecian Princes vnyted, hadd not withſtoode this furie.</p>
               <p>In midſt was his laſt tree broken: ſo was he conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to vſe the ſtrength of his armes and nayles, that were longer then a ſpanne, wherewith he embraced the tender Lady. And becauſe he could not penetrate her ſure armor, (for that ſaued her life) hee tumbled her vp and downe with ſuch force, that ſhee recouered her ſelfe, in no ſmall wonder, to ſee her ſelfe in her enemies clawes. She would not ſtriue with him, till ſhee tooke him at aduantage, and ſo ſtaying till hee turned her on her right ſide, ſhee ſtrained her ſelfe with ſuch ſtrength, that ſhee ſcapte his nayles. And not omitting that occaſion before ſhee ſtept from him, ſhe wounded him on the breſt ſo mightily with her ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſword, that the blood like ſpoutes burſt from his vaines, wherewith he ſtained the white paued yarde.</p>
               <p>Hereat the <hi>Centaure</hi> beganne to rore ſo fiercely, that the noiſe was heard of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince that was left without, which ſo tormented him with feare of his Ladies daunger, that without longer ſtay, he caſt himſelfe through thoſe fierie flames, following the Eccho of the noiſe that ſtil increaſed:
<pb facs="tcp:13977:25"/>
for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Heroyeke Lady, had ſo wounded him on the legg, that almoſt ſhee had cut it cleane aſunder. Admiration would the ſight of this battaile breede: for the nimbleneſſe and dexteritie that awayted on <hi>Roſamond</hi> cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, which had ſo tyred the Centaure, as it had her ſelfe: which he not able to ſuffer, ſeeing his blood ſo faſt to runne, cloaſed with the Ladie, cruſhing her ſo ſtrongly, that ſhee could not fetch her breath: Yet not ſo much, but ſhee could finde force to vſe her dagger, which then ſhee thought would moſt aſſiſt her, with which, ayming at the monſters breſt, ſhee ſtucke it therein vp to the hilts, that he was forced to let her go. But feeling himſelfe ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he tooke vp the remainder of his Oake, and with it, began to ſtryke the Lady with ſuch ſtrength, that her fleſh and bones he bruſed, and ſo after ſtaggering her, that it was a wonder ſhee ſuſtained her ſelfe ſo long. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the honour riſing by that aduenture, and how ſhee had left her deare Lord without, ſhee ſo animated her ſelfe with an inuincible reſolution, either to end that perrilous attempt, or elſe to leaue her life, as a trophie of her valour. Whereupon ſhee made, as if ſhee would receiue a blowe vpon her ſhield, holding her ſworde with the point againſt him, it happened as ſhee deſired: For he diſcharged it as if he ment to cleaue a rocke: but eſcaping it, ſtept vnder his armes, bearing her point forward, thruſting it to the hiltes, which made him looſe his blowe, yet not his cloſing her betwixt his armes, ſo ſorely cruſhing her with the pangs of death, that both as dead, fel down on the ground, wherewith the heauens were darkened with clowdes and foggie miſtes, with lightening and thundering, as if then the vtter deſolation of the worlde were come: which paſt, there appeared in the middle of the yard, a moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Table, whereon were ſet Pyramides like maſſiue golde: vnder it lay the <hi>Centaure</hi> and the Lady, both pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the bodies, which ſight was able to draw pitie from a Rocke. At this time entred the Prince of <hi>Dacia,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:25"/>
in queſt of his deare Lady: But ſeeing the Tombe, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to it, whereon he read theſe wordes:
<q>The life of <hi>Roſamond</hi> dependeth on him, that through compaſsion will giue his, to redeeme hers, contenting ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dye himſelfe, then that the world ſhould ſo ſoone looſe her.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here woulde not <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> expreſſe the griefe, nor ſette downe the extremitie of diſcontent, that <hi>Don Eleno</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, ſuppoſſing her dead, whome dearer then his ſoule he tendered, his tongue ceaſt her moouing, his lippes cleaft to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and all the motions of his breathing ſenſes ſo loſt their powers, that to complaine him hee wanted ſtrength, his eyes he Metamorphoſed in his Lady as ſhe lay. In this manner did hee bewéepe the greateſt loſſe vntill his breath gaue leaue to publiſh his ſorrowe, beginning with a déepe ſighe bitterly to exclaime aloude, whoſe noiſe refreſhing the memorie of his woes, made him to burſt to theſe exclaimes: Ah cruell Goddeſſe of inconſtant happines, howe well haſt thou manifeſted the extremes of thy mutabilities? on whom didſt thou euer ſhewe the power of ſo monſtrous tyrannie: that ere I could enioy ſo rich a good, myne eyes ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſo diſaſtrous an euill? but indéede it was a happineſſe to perfect to continue? Oh deceiptfull deceipt, howe ſoone haſt thou taken the full poſſeſſion of my hart aſſuring mee, there is nothing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to be truſted, ſpecially if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by her hands, that neuer did aſſure any thinge but for a greater loſſe. Oh dyuine Princeſſe, lyfe of that body whom thou leaueſt behinde, eternally to bewayle thy time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe end: wherein did thy <hi>Eleno</hi> ſo offend thée that he maye not follow thée in ſo ſower a ſtorme, which to him were more pleaſant then the paſſage through the ſtarry Firmament? Oh you Siſters of <hi>Phaeton</hi> Miſtres of ſorrow, and you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Nymphes that dayly waile the pitious hap of <hi>Nio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> ſtony change, come and vnite your woes in one, &amp; helpe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:26"/>
me to lament that loſſe, whoſe greatneſſe ſo exceeds, that if I ſhould melt in diſtilled ſhowers of briniſh teares, it were too little for ſo deare a want.</p>
               <p>Now tyrannous <hi>Goddeſſe</hi> maiſt thou reſt content, hauing bereft the worlde of his true ornament, his richeſt Iewell. Now remaines there nothing, whereon to extend the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of thy power, with greater honour, vnleſſe thou wilt ſtill offend hers that thou haſt ſlaine. Pardon mee (ſacred Lady, for the offence againſt thy beautie by me committed, is not ſmall, by lingring thus long in the world, thy ſelfe being out of it. None with more reaſon ought to loue but I, which I ſhall not ſeeme to doe, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute proroging an abortiue, and deſpiſed life. But of more force is the effect which forceth, then the cauſe that gaue occaſion of my death? Here ending, reſolued to approue his firme loyaltie with his heart blood, remembring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his <hi>Roſamond,</hi> he ſnatched the dagger out of her handes, and lifting the ſkirt of his armour, hee ſtabbd it directly to his hart, ſaying: It is perpetuall death, (not life, while ſhee hath it not, that was wont to giue it to the Prince of <hi>Dacia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he had ſcarce beganne that bloudie ſacrifice, when with more horror, and fearfull noyſe then the <hi>Cyclops</hi> make with their pouderous hammers in <hi>Vulcans</hi> Forge, the Theater, Toombe, and Battlements, with the yarde did vaniſh, onely the Temple did remaine, in middeſt wherrof, lay the two faithfull louers harde by the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous <hi>Centaure,</hi> which outright was ſlaine by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned ſworde of <hi>Semiramis:</hi> (and this was not the laſt aduenture that it ended with immortall honour, and no ſmall labour of the Lady, who with the greateſt content that may be immagined, went to her true Knight, and caſting her amorous armes about his necke, imbracing him ſhee ſaide: Who with a wiſh (moſt valarous Prince) might deſire, at this inſtant, ali the forepaſt hanghtie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and alſo they that with labour infinite to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall

Then ariued the King being aduertiſed what did happen, who with incredible ioye embraced the Knights, and his deare Daughter, (that one of the worlds chiefe beauties was) humbly requeſting the knights to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a while in his Court, where they ſhould be intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as their merits had deſerued.

               <p>The <hi>Dacian</hi> told y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King who he was, which greatly glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, which occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kindled in him a perfect fire of true friendſhip, which one day he made it knowne vnto him.

that euer, he either heard or ſawe, of fower knights alone.

proceede without the implored ayde of ſome immortall helpe: of your deuineſt beauties, (perfect perfections of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures pure rarieties) whoſe honour ſhal with reading this ſimple ſtorie, guild it with your woorth, doe I praye that fauour, without which I cannot proſecute the praiſes of your vnſtained purities. Infuſe (ſweete Ladyes) parte of your ſacred helpes, to ſharpen my dull ſences, that from your power they may take power with a bolde reuyued ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to vnfolde a worke more intricate and difficult, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vntreading of the Laborinthian Maze.

But deluding my penſiue immaginations, with my effect-obtayned prayers. The couragious <hi>Dacian,</hi> at length approached where they thus contended for the combate alreadie begun, and ſtepping to them thus ſaid: Withhold awhile braue Knightes, for it doth not belong to thoſe that glories in that name, to aſſalt any with aduantage.</p>
               <p>The vtmoſt of extrrame rage did poſſeſſe the true louer of <hi>Oliuia,</hi> that not regarding the deuiſe of his couſen, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him with turning his ſwift horſe, and with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>immagined ſpeede, the flower of the worlds chiualrie, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred in the middle of that ſpacious field, with no leſſe terror, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if two well rigged Gallies had met. Good were the Knight of <hi>Cupids</hi> armour, yet <hi>Don Elenos</hi> admittes no compare, whereby their Launces could not take hold, but in ſhiuers mounted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayre, where in the fourth Spheare they were receiued as meſſengers from ſo valiant warriors that without alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their ſaddles, returned with their ſwords in hand. The <hi>Dacian</hi> had the beſt blade in the earth
<pb facs="tcp:13977:29"/>
(except his Ladies) &amp; againſt it no inchantment preuailed. Together they diſcharged y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength of their puiſant armes vpon eithers head, making them bowe to the ſaddles pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, with ſuch reuerence, as befitted two ſuch Princes. And ſo they began one of the braueſt battailes in the world, with more noiſe and furie, then if it were between twentie Knights. Mightie and inuincible was <hi>Don Elenos</hi> power, but here he met his equall in the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> (that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Milo</hi> would maintaine the field) making him glowe like a kindled cole of fire. Yet for all that, did not he behaue himſelfe beſt: for no blow did light on him, but mangled his fleſh, bruzed his bones, &amp; rent his armour: whereof the lookers on were not a little amazed, knowing <hi>Roſicler,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo buſie in the combate of one Knight: and he being therewith vexed to the hart, tooke his ſword twixt both his hands, &amp; went to his enemie, giuing him ſo fierce a blowe on the ſide of his Helme, that it made him looſe his feeling, falling on his horſes necke, he doubled another ſomewhat higher, &amp; ſuch a one as his armour then gaue him his life. Neuertheleſſe, the blood guſht out at his Beuer. Oh who would not now feare to ſee <hi>Don Eleno</hi> that recouering him ſelfe more furious then a ſauage Lyon poſſeſt with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Feuer ſpurd againſt his Coſen, &amp; with both his hands not miſſing his Helme, it little auailed him, for the ſworde and the ſtrength that did guide it, ſnatcht away the toppe with his plume of feathers, &amp; with <hi>Mars</hi> his puiſance deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on his right ſhoulder, he layde him on his horſe crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the which ſetting his knees on the earth, through the ſtrength of the blowe ſtoode ſtill. The loued <hi>Dacian</hi> was no Knight to omit ſo good occaſion &amp; chifely with ſuch a horſe: pricking him with the ſpurres, he made him runne againſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi> It is doubtfull &amp; not yet determined, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> got any honor by the deede: for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo braue a horſe, it was no maruell if he had ouerthrowen the <hi>Greeke</hi> &amp; his, who in a tryce lept from him. But this cuſtome had the <hi>Dacians Tyrio,</hi> that in ſight he pardoned none on foote, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13977:29"/>
ſo returned vpon the <hi>Greeke,</hi> ſtriking him with his breſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was forſt backe, with much adoe, ſauing himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. He paſt forwards, &amp; like a furious Tygre ſaid, knight: either let me take my horſe, or a light fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thine, vnleſſe thou wilt haue me paſſe the limits of Chiualrie, or breake the lawes of a good Knight. Mount vpon yours (Sir Knight) ſaid the <hi>Dacian</hi> to the <hi>Greeke:</hi> for with him may you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what your valour doth aſſure you. So he lept on his, rayning him about at ſuch time, as there arryued a great troope of Knights from <hi>Grecia:</hi> and looking on them he knew they were his father, brother, &amp; the reſt of his frends, that not a little did reioyce to ſee him, &amp; he with them, who knew him by the deuiſe of his ſhield. And yet left they him (and with reaſon) to applaud with more then admiration the mortall battaile twixt the other foure.</p>
               <p>Somewhat did the <hi>Tinacrian</hi> knowe his aduantage, yet was it ſo little, that a thouſande times the Pagan made him doubt his victorie: For like a rauenous Wolfe that wanted his praye, did hee combate. Without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling feare I dare not approche vnto the wonder of val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and beautie, that with <hi>Claridiano</hi> made her battaile, with ſuch furie, that well ſhee blazoned her ſelfe to be no leſſe then <hi>Archiſilora</hi> Soueraigne Queene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> who more furious then a hungrie Vulture, had ſo wearyed the Knight (and her ſelfe no leſſe tyred) that it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable.</p>
               <p>And he in the Purple, gaue the Ladye a blowe, that taking her on the toppe of the ſhielde, it ioyned it with her Helme, and ſomewhat it aſtoniſhed her, and quickly with a ſyde thruſt vpon it, he had almoſt tumbled her to the ground. The Lady recouered her ſelfe, and with both handes laide on the Purple Knight, &amp; had it bene at full, it could not but haue indangered him: for it made him with the paine ſhrinke euen to his ſaddle pummell, with a ſudden leape ſhe ſtept to him with two thruſts one after an other, which not only raiſed him, but laid him along vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
<pb facs="tcp:13977:30"/>
Courſers backe, and as he lay ſhee gaue him a downe right blow, that it almoſt draue him out of all féeling. He retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to himſelfe with the laſt ſtroke, and ſetling himſelfe in his ſaddle, and cruſhing one tooth with another, he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Ladie, whoſe ſight would haue feared the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God of Warre euen in his own ſpheare: yet in her it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no ſparke thereof: perhaps ſhee was ſure, with that blowe to conquer her enemy, although ſhe receiued it. She awaited it, which was ſuch, (ah who might here aduertiſe thee free youth, firſt to breake thy ſwoord then to execute it: For without conqueſt, thereby thou looſeſt thy libertie, and more, the verie hope of Remedie: for the Ladies chaſte gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie doth farther extend it ſelfe then ſo) that lighting on the toppe of her helme backwardes, he tumbled it to the earth, and with a little more ſhe had done the like, for the ſtrength of the blowe did driue her much backwards. And returning to her ſelfe, ſhe ſpread her armour with tramels of more yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low haire, than <hi>Apollo's</hi> in his moſt pride, and ſhewed the beawtie of her face more glorious than the ſpangled couert of the heauen, yet hers ſhined with more excellencie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe adorned with the ſplendor of twoo goulden <hi>Sunnes.</hi> Aſtoniſhed with a ſudden admiration ſtood the <hi>Greeke,</hi> reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo farre hers, that the mortall ſtroake of all conquering death was not able to bereaue him of the glorie that there he wonne. Well did the Lady note it, at that inſtant recording the remembrance of the Knight ſhe did ſee portrayed in the Caſtle where ſhe obtayned the ſiluer branch, yet ſhee let it paſſe, though not without infinite rapping alterations, at the gates of her all wondring breaſt. But poſſeſt with rage, ſhe cloſed with the <hi>Greeke,</hi> that was prepared to receiue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptleſſe accompt of ſuch fauours, &amp; catching at his helme, ſhee pluckt it off, diſcouering a more fairer face than <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders,</hi> cauſer of the deadlie diſcordes between the <hi>Greekes</hi> and the deſtroyed <hi>Troians.</hi> There had ſhee kild him with the dagger that in her handes ſhe had, if the Prince had not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her with more ſtrength then doth the Iuie incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe

the ſtraight towering Elme, and ſtaying her hand, ſaid. Soft (ſoueraigne Ladie) doe not at once expreſſe ſo many extreames: hauing ſoly with that of your more than deuine beautie, carried away the palme of a triumphing victorie from the battaile of an euer conquering minde, and as a trophie of ſo memorable a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt: I preſent to you my ſwoord, as the ſpoyles of my ſubiection: let it ſuffice, for it is no true Nobilitie to require more of a vanquiſht Captiue that willingly ſubmitteth to your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund: to the which, not onely I, but all that in the circled Orbe doe breath, ought to acknowledge, I will mainetaine againſt them all, yf you vouchſafe my life, the which can be but ſhort, longer continuing in your diſgrace. Well conceaued the Ladie to what end his ſpeeches were directed, whereat ſhe nothing grieued, bicauſe in her penſiue thoughts ſhe iudged him one of the faireſt and ſtrongeſt Knights vnder the compaſſe of <hi>Phaebus</hi> daylie ſhining courſe. And ſo letting him goe (to the Princes no ſmall griefe) ſhee ſaid, ſir Knight I would not by ſo many waies reſt vanquiſhed, it ſufficeth mee to haue knowen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valour that the heauens haue adorned you with, to acquite you of this combate. The Emperour ſtopt his replie, running in haſt vnto the warlike Queene (for euerie one did know her) ſaying: why how now (Heroicke Queene?) I neuer had thought, that your armes were bent gainſt this your Gretian Empyre? and eſpecially to bereaue me of my Nephew, whome I more tender then my ſoule? I will craue the amends of <hi>Claridiana,</hi> bicauſe ſhe may take it, for her ſonne. Moſt mightie Emperor (replyed the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Matrone) the honor of a diſtreſſed Ladie is well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Grecia</hi> that it makes me thinke I haue moſt cauſe of complainte, and thereof will I intreate one of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces preſent (poynting to the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi>) the care to defend my reputation on my behalfe. We are all yours (great Ladie anſweared he) and chiefly to obay your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, by how much the more, the glorie is ſo great, which at your hands <hi>Claridiano</hi> hath receaued, that he for himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:31"/>
and vs, ſhall acknowledge the dutie that we all doe owe you. There did the <hi>Tynacrian</hi> well know his father, and brothers, and perceiuing that he in the Purple was his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, highly reioyced to haue ſuch kindred. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſeeing what little honour he had gotten in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, he ſaide vnto the <hi>Moore:</hi> Thou ſeeſt King of <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,</hi> that theſe Knights haue knowen each other, whereby it is impoſſible we ſhould end our combate, and bycauſe the night approcheth, as alſo for that among them I haue ſuch kinſfolkes that knowing me would diſturbe vs, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while they be thus buſie take vp thy Lady behind thee, and ſtay for me in the forreſt whither I will followe thee, and their onely death ſhall part our fight, the which, for many cauſes I doe: For no leſſe doeſt thou gréeue me wearing that armour, then the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes, that demaunds them of thee. Be it as thou wilt haue it, replyed the furious <hi>Pagan.</hi> And ſo with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwifteſt running of their horſes, taking the Lady, they thruſt themſelues through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woods. But with the nightes approche, the <hi>Tynacrian</hi> loſt his waye, wandring farre from the place the <hi>Pagan</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him. To each of them befell things worthie the reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, as ſhalbe mentioned in his due time. For now the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile betweene <hi>Roſicler</hi> and <hi>Eleno</hi> muſt not be forgotten, which ſeemed but then to begin. For either had rather dye then in that preſence to ſhewe want of valour. Well did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

which is <hi>Roſicler,</hi> yet neuertheleſſe ſhall not Fortune make me thinke but that I haue <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia</hi> between my armes, to whom I will now ſatisfie the diſpleaſure I did him in the Citie of <hi>Cymarra.</hi> It is I (replyed he) that there fell in the greateſt error that euer Knight committed: And therefore I doe beſeech your Soueraigne Maieſtie, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it me, and in ſigne you haue done ſo, grant me licence to part: For the firſt (braue Couſin) anſwered the Emperor, you haue you wiſh, for I dare not thinke my ſelfe ſecure within <hi>Conſtantinople, Don Eleno</hi> being diſpleaſed: But touching the laſt, there is no excuſe muſt ſerue, for now I haue you in my power, I will not let you ſo depart. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe your Maieſtie (replied the Prince) by the faith of a Knight, it is in my power to doe no otherwiſe, hauing left my companie behinde: and ſo it will be diſcourteſie, if I do not retourne: But I pawne mine Honor to your Highnes, not to depart your Empyre til I haue done my duty both to your ſelfe, &amp; to my Ladie Aunt the Empreſſe. On that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I let you goe (anſwered the Emperor) though I ſhal not be mercy till you accompliſh it. Thereuppon demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Launce, and taking his leaue of his Couſins, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned with more furie then doth a Comet blaze through the ayre, leauing them all contented with his gallant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, who with griefe for want of his Ladie, tormented brauely his inchaunted horſe, in ſuch ſort loozing his way, that before hee met her hee ſhed manye teares, meeting with no ſmall dangers: what they were ſhall ere long bee ſpecified: For now <hi>Meridian</hi> and the <hi>Troian</hi> expecting this time, vnbuckled their helmes, and went to ſpeake vnto the Emperour, who entertained them with that Maieſtie that the higheſt God aboue all others had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and ſo ſaid, Let vs go (braue Princes) backe to the Cittie, for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe muſt enioy with vs theſe ioyfull tidings. <hi>Galtenor</hi> would be firſt that ſhould tell it them, who thus ſpake: In ſatisfaction of the diſcontent I gaue you (great Princes) by taking away the Princes my deare Children, receaue this
<pb facs="tcp:13977:32"/>
ſmall ſeruice, I meane the glad newes of the comming of the Princes <hi>Roſicler, Meridian,</hi> and <hi>Oriſtides</hi> with the mighty Queene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> who are comming to the Cittie, after the finiſhing of a mortall battell between my ſonne <hi>Claridiano,</hi> and her, wherein both were conquerers of each other, a greater faulte then this ſhould haue bene forgiuen you. Mighty Kinge replied the <hi>Empres,</hi> for the ioyfull newes you haue giuen theſe Princeſſes. In faith the leſte ſhall not be the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuias</hi> (ſaid <hi>Claridiana</hi>) for we all haue taken parte of her greefes, and with reaſon, wanting no leſſe then <hi>Roſicler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo when they all arriued, they receaued one another with the greateſt content in the world. I heere (faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes) ſhunne a tedious trouble-ſome prolixitie, referring to your thoughts y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch courteſies that betwene ſuch ſtates, in ſuch occaſions is required. Hee that worſt ſped was poore <hi>Claridiano</hi> that could ſpeake neuer a word vnto his Ladie: for ſhe was ſo free and graue, that it made her diſſemble what her harte ſufferd, keeping the Prince thereby in wonderfull torments. But to the purpoſe: Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes and feaſtes are theſe that are ordained to drowne in obliuion the moſt memorableſt that euer in the world were ſeene.</p>
               <p>The Ladies appointed for chalengers, and their defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (of certaine Iuſtes to be ſolemnyzed twenty daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the valiant <hi>Troian Oriſtides,</hi> the hawghty <hi>Branſineano</hi> ſonne vnto the puiſant Prince <hi>Brandezell</hi> of <hi>Percia,</hi> and of the Princeſſe <hi>Clarinea</hi> a Knight no doubte of the braueſt in the vniuerſe, whom a litle before the <hi>Emperor</hi> had Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And the third with them was the coragious <hi>Clarindo</hi> (then alſo Knighted) ſonne vnto <hi>Lindaraza</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Such were theſe Knights that euery one ſaid, that the honour of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Ladies would be well defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. All the court began to prepare their armour, horſes and beſt abilliments of war &amp; the gallant amorous youthes to ſolicite their Ladies for fauors againſt that daye. The

               <p>It is proper vnto louers, to feare the thing loued, though hauing it preſent, then how much the more, ſeeing it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſo doubtfull, and not knowing where it was.

deſire, then neuer had any arriued vnto the topp of true Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, by reiecting of croſſe ſucceſſes only to knowe a tranſitorie good.</p>
               <p>The touch-ſtone of valiantnes it is, wherwith their honor to eternitie is purified, as alſo to haue mighty &amp; cruell foes, that obteyning a hard victorie, the triumph maie be more ſweet, then that atchiued without blood. Neuer did <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the mightie <hi>Macedonian</hi> conqueror your Predeceſſor more eſteme of any Kingdome, then of the Pertians, becauſe none coſte him ſomuch blood. And that for which apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was ſeene to preferre all perills was for the famous <hi>Aſia,</hi> bycauſe the very deſire of the ſame would reioyce him, eſpecially, when vpon the borders of the riuer Sale he muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered all his wel furniſhed hoſt, receiuing a pleaſure excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding meaſure, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wauering of his diſplaied enſignes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire, the neighing noice of his barbed ſteeds, &amp; the ſound of innumerable military inſtruments for warre: But what moſt did delight him was, his marching againſt <hi>Aſia.</hi> And ſo being demanded the cauſe of it, this was his anſwere to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one. Bycauſe I know it will coſt much, and that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe it is worth ſo much. He neuer did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue, a thought of care for the bridge that ſo many yeares was in building, nor yet for the toile in making firme land in midle of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Sea,</hi> and why? for his perpetuall fames immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that thereby he hoped.</p>
               <p>This haue I ſaid (magnanimous Prince) bycauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming your ſelfe with his wil that hath it ſo appointed, you ſhould not looſe the glorie of a valiant ſufferance, by giuing exteriour ſignes of feeling this buſineſſe thus greeuouſly. I well know the waight therof, &amp; what reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is to waile ſo great a loſſe, with eternall teares of liuing luke-warme hartes blood: But I finde it a ſtayne to your honour, a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to your Nobilitie, and a weakning of your valour, in not ſhewing it, ſufficient to reſiſt, a more vnhappier chance. for ſhe cannot be in place ſo ſecret but it will be knowne, and once found, who will dare without death to hinder what
<pb facs="tcp:13977:33"/>
ſoly is due vnto your vertues? And liuing aſſured that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> is yours, and you her deare eſpouſe, what euill maye happen that this conſideration, will not make gentle &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and her abſence tollerable? Glad and in truth verye glad, became the faire youth <hi>Roſabell,</hi> with his tender har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friends diſcourſe, becauſe hee knew he had reaſon, and ſo hee thus replied. Valiant Prince and my ſoules trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, now reſt I fully ſatiſfied, &amp; more aſſured that we ſhal happily terminate all our affaires, ſince fortune had reſerud me ſo good a woes comforter, and griefes diminiſher with your deare companie: and becauſe it is no vertue vtterly to diſpaire, I will hope, and expect how the heauens will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Lyriana,</hi> to both our euerlaſting ioyes, for fortune will not ſo farre proſecute her rigour againſt me, as at leaſt not to ſhew me the place of her abode, that with the fauor of your mightie arme, I maye recouer that felicitie, that my teares and your valour ſhall purchaſe. I would it were no more but ſo (deare <hi>Roſabell</hi> replyed the Prince of <hi>Antioch</hi>) for it ſhould more eaſier be accompliſht then the buſines wee goe about: And becauſe I thinke it fitte we returne to the Kings that ſo well ayded vs, we may ſet forwards in our way: and let me not ſee you no more ſo paſſionate, for you will but grieue me: And more torments and more paines indured your father in his louing pilgrimage, yet neuer had the like fauour that yeſterday you poſſeſt, neuertheleſſe, he did not deſiſt with content to proſecute his Chiualries: let therefore his magnanimitie no leſſe ſhine in the Sunne, nor in mee no leſſe loue and true amitie, then my Fathers towards yours, till in your behalfe I ſacrifice my ſoules life, to winne your happines.</p>
               <p>But let vs goe, for now your ſorrow wil be iniuſt, hauing one ſo to mittigate it: and let vs take all aduantage in theſe affaires, admitting no battle one without another, &amp; though we both demand it, we muſt ſuffer ſo many to vndertake yt on their part. For this <hi>Souldan</hi> is verie ſubtle, &amp; hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gyants his frends, certainly it is like he wil to ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:13977:34"/>
them commit that battaile, ſo his intent might be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, ſuppoſing that none wil dare to attempt it. For the Kings through feare of them. Thus diſcourſed theſe two deare friends, till they approched ſo nigh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of <hi>Nyque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> that her gates winked vpon them, on the bank of whoſe riuer they alighted to paſſe the tediouſneſſe of the night in pleaſing chat of that peereleſſe Lady, and of the great deſire they had to paſſe into <hi>Grecia.</hi> There he recompted the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile he had with his Father in <hi>Lacedemonia</hi> vnknowen, whereby he vnderſtood he was his ſonne. In this prattle continued they, till it was time to ſleepe, and ſo departing one a little from the other, they made their ſhields their pillowes, and ſo reſted the greateſt part of the night. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they awaked togither, either full of carefull thoughtes, for the others griefe. For therin is ciphered the true patterne of perfect friendſhip. And ſeeing thus penſiuely they heard the grones of ſome Knight that complained: togither they roſe, and taking their ſhieldes and Helmes without any worde they went ſoftly to heare what he ſaide. And being nigh him, they ſaw by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reflecting light of <hi>Cinthias</hi> beames, a well proportioned Knight, clad all in blacke armour, who lying vnder a bigg growen Oake, complained againſt the ſkyes, loue and Fortune. Oh heauens (ſaid the afflicted <hi>More</hi>) how long will you ſuffer him to liue, from whome death doth fly? Why giue ye me life, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing thanke you for it, becauſe tis hatefull to me? Why permitted ye my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to be from thence, if on the earth I ſhall liue dying? Oh ſuffer not <hi>Bembo</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaya,</hi> to liue with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paſſions, when you may end it with one gentle death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer better welcome may come then now? Oh ſoueraigne Princeſſe of <hi>Niquea,</hi> how iuſtly maiſt thou complain of me, that louing thee ſo deerely, haue bene ſo remiſſe to viſite thee? Oh forgetfull louer, if thou didſt liue in <hi>Achaya</hi> louing, why didſt thou then ſo long proroge thy comming, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Liriana</hi> was in <hi>Niquea</hi> whereby thy delay is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe, thou muſt dye, not ſeeing her, being thy only deſire, as the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:13977:34"/>
happieſt life? and now (Prince of miſfortune) behooues it thee to pilgrimage throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds vaſt continents, to know her habitation? which thou hadſt ſaued comming in time, &amp; then who would haue bene able or ſomuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to thinke in his trembling harte to take her from thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? Oh hawtie and preſumptuous Knight, who may know what thou art, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I might make thee acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrong thou haſt done me? taking what only to my worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was due? How maie I call my ſelfe Nephew to that mighty <hi>Bembo,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcourge &amp; terror of all <hi>Greece</hi> ſuffering another to inioy whome thou doſt loue? neuer more would I haue put on armour if I did not make him confeſſe this fowle iniurie? And yet there is no reaſon why? for ſeing <hi>Liriana</hi> was of beautie Angelical, it was like, others would loue her: and if fortune did fauour him to carry her away, I haue no cauſe to lament, &amp; bewaile, but my ſlow hart, and ſluggiſh thoughts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſpurd me not afore this to viſit her.</p>
               <p>Oh my friend <hi>Nicandro,</hi> how maie I complaine of thee bycauſe it is thy fault? for hadſt thou by thy ſkill aduertized me of this ſucceſſe, who would haue deferd ſuch a voiage, though it had coſte him a thouſand liues? and come, were it only but to ſee her, whom to me thou didſt canonize for beautie, as the ſole meritor of my faith. So penſiue reſted the braue greeke <hi>Roſabell,</hi> ſeing what that Knight did, and hearing what he ſaid againſt his reputation, affecting that Ladie that more then his proper life he loued, that he knew not how to reſolue himſelfe, till <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> perceauing his alteration ſtept to him, ſaying. Valiant Prince, ſeing by delaie the Kings doe incurre ſo great danger, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full you ſhould procure now new battels: and eſpecially he knowing they are priſoners about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtealing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes, it cannot be but he will offer himſelfe in that demaund, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their defence will your combate be more iuſtified, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this inſtant: for though he loues whome you do, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of contrarie paſſions may excuſe you: but being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of her loue towards you, great reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue you to forgiue him. Great is the wrong heerein I doe my Lade (replyed
<pb facs="tcp:13977:35"/>
                  <hi>Roſabell,</hi> but your will be fulfilled, for I am determined al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to follow your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile. All that <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> had ſaid, was true: for <hi>Bembo</hi> was then thither come for no other purpoſe, but to maintaine, that the priſoners were conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe ſtealing. And had not <hi>Roſabell</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoldo</hi> ſtaied to defend it, there had byn none able from him to beare away the victorie, becauſe he was one of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the world, and he that moſt perſecuted <hi>Greece</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great warres. He was verie yong, and the moſt courteous of all his Nation. He would not ſuffer his ſubiects to crown him King, till he had traueld the worlde, and ſo created he gouernors ouer his kingdome, and accompanied with his valour onely he departed from <hi>Achaya,</hi> with that mornfull deuiſe, that many thought it ſignified more then it did. He was the amorouſeſt that euer woman brought foorth, and he that was moſt loyall to <hi>Liriana:</hi> for after he knew her to be married, he ſtill doted on her, alleaging, that he did loue, and had referd the guerdon of his loyaltie to the graciouſnes of his Lady: but if ſhe reiected his true loue paſſions, yet he would not forget her: for it were to iniurie his faith, that from the beginning he had conſecrated to her beautie. And had fortune but a little fauoured him he had bene one of the famous Princes of the worlde, but ſeeing himſelfe ſo cruelly by loue perſecuted, did often make him looſe part of his high valour. From him departed the two friendes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning where they had left their horſes, expecting the mornings approch, which ſcarce appeared, ſaluting the brightneſſe of the Sunnes vpriſing, when mounted on their courſers, they had not galloped farre, but the glittering of <hi>Nyqueas</hi> gates reflected on their armours. Not long after did the valiant competitor do the like vpon a great &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Bay Courſer, without any ſpot, and of the beſt broode that euer was ſeene: for as ſuch a one it was giuen him by his louing friend the wiſe <hi>Nycandro.</hi> So ſoone as he ſawe the two Knightes before him, with a little more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ſpeede he ouertooke them, &amp; being nigh them, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
<pb facs="tcp:13977:35"/>
in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better to diſſemble) what countrey that was. It is ſo little (ſir Knight) ſince we ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued here (anſwered <hi>Roſabell</hi>) that we are altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of your demaund, hauing not met any of whome wee might knowe, what you deſire. The ariuing of another Knight of as braue apparances as any of them, interrupted his replie: This was <hi>Don Clariſell,</hi> that guyded by <hi>Luper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, Gellaſios</hi> maiſter, was come in the <hi>Souldans</hi> behalfe, though he ariued too late, for he had already ſent to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for a ſubiect of his the fierceſt of many Gyants that he knewe, being come to them, with great courteſie he reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted what <hi>Bembo</hi> had done before. But as euerye one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled their knowledge, they ſtayde till they might meete with ſome of whome they might learne their doubt: Long ſtayed they not but they ſaw a Page in great haſt come wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping from the Cittie, and méeting with the foure Princes ſayde. Ah me, braue Knights if in you there be what your gallantnes doth manifeſt, now you may approue it, by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring of three Kinges, that vniuſtly are accuſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rape made of the Princeſſe and her couzen, by the deformedſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in the vniuerſe: &amp; I am ſure they are in no fault. Leade the way good Page, (ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couragious <hi>Roſabell</hi>) for I wil for them hazard my perſon in any danger, and I will mine if it be néedfull ſayd <hi>Oriſtoldo.</hi> The <hi>Aſſirian</hi> that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bould, would no longer forbeare, but ſayde, I woulde not haue on my part Knights ſo reſolute. Then be you of the other ſayd <hi>Oriſtoldo,</hi> and you ſhall ſee that our reſolution is grounded on our armes and not on our tongues, &amp; without more ſtay they rayned about their Horſes, and with their ſwifteſt pace they ſtraight went to the Cittie. The lyke did the other two, remayning with great deſire to combate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch confident Knights, ſpecially he in the black, whome <hi>Roſabells</hi> behauiour highly pleaſed, hee had reaſon for on horſe-backe fewe were like him. At length the firſt two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at the pallaice after the <hi>Souldan</hi> had Dyned, being accompanyed with his chiefe Nobilitie, becauſe he would
<pb facs="tcp:13977:36"/>
haue the Kinge of <hi>Garamantes</hi> cauſe tryed before them, for he would not beléeue but he had conſented to the rape. And that he might be more ſure of his reuenge, he had called the proude <hi>Grantel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Gyant was alſo in the great hall, for the <hi>Souldan</hi> to honour him more had inuited him. And ſtraight he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the three Kings to be brought with ſuffitient garde, to whome the <hi>Souldan</hi> ſayd. Knights you ſee what all my ſubiects doe obiect againſt you, that you were confederates in my deare Daughters rape, but I becauſe I woulde in ſome reſpect beléeue the contrarie, haue put it to the tryall of a battell: and ſo within foure days may you preſent your Champion to combate againſt him that my counſell hath aſſigned, who is the King of the <hi>Altana</hi> Iſles, that is here, The King of <hi>Garamantes</hi> thus replyed.</p>
               <p>Greatly are we wronged (mighty Lord) to haue this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle taken from our armes; knowing none in thy Kingdome on whom we might repoſe ſo waightie a charge, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready vrged that (ſayd the Gyant) and intreated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Souldan</hi> that you three might be admitted thereunto: but ſeeing hee ſayth there is a law inuiolate that forbids it, take no care for that, for I giue leaue, and will admit Ten Knights in your behalfe, againſt all whom together, I alone will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you were confederates in the rape of the gracious <hi>Liri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Niquea.</hi> As the fearefull King was about to anſwere, the couragious Greekes, ſtopped foorth (backe with his friend <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi>) who doing his humble obeyſance vnto the <hi>Souldan,</hi> ſayd vnto him in the <hi>Aſſirian</hi> tongue, the which he knewe he could well ſpeake. In the entring of thy great Cittie (great <hi>Monarch</hi> of this faire Empire) comming to ſéek for the King of <hi>Garamantes</hi> my Lord and ſoueraigne, I vnderſtoode what on thy behalfe was againſt his honour obiected: And my ſelfe being aſſured of his vertues, relying
<pb facs="tcp:13977:36"/>
thereon, I am reſolued to vndertake the battle for him, and for the reſt, to the extremeſt hazard of my life, becauſe I am certaine of his right. Greatly reioyced the impriſoned Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeeing him come in ſuch opportunitie, for they ſtraight knewe him by his azure deuiſe, to whome the <hi>Souldan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. The tryall (ſir Knight) is already remitted to bee arbitrated by combate, and ſo there remaines no more then that theſe Kinges doe graunt it, and then may you ſtraight performe it.</p>
               <p>Braue couzen (ſayd the King of <hi>Garamantes</hi> to <hi>Roſabell</hi>) I for my part giue you all my power thereto, reſting not a little aſſured, of the good ſucceſſe, hauing ſo great iuſtice on my ſide, and ſo braue a knight to defend it. We graunt the like, ſayd the other Kinges. Seing this is done (ſayde the Gréeke humbling himſelfe for the impoſed charg) command mightie <hi>Souldan</hi> (turned to him) the apparance of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger, and I beſeech you that the priſoners may bee ſet in place, that the battle ended, they may without impediment depart. Like a deuilliſh furie did the furious <hi>Pagan</hi> ſteppe foorth ſaying. Why how now Knight, ſo ſure art thou of the end, that before thou ſéeſt me thou dareſt demaunde the prize of the battle? But now conſider, knowing what thou haſt to doe, &amp; againſt whom, whether thou wilt yet affirme thy ſpéeches. Not only doe I it, ſayd the (hawghty youth) but ſayd it waxeth late till it be done. Then I aduiſe thee Knight (replyed the Gyant) that if thou wilt thou mayeſt, choſe to ayd thée beſides thy companion eight knights more, for to that nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber haue I chalenged.

Diſcourteous Giant farr more proude tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant (ſaide the bould <hi>Britanian</hi>) take thy armes, for I alone will giue thee ſo much worke, that I will make thee won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the droppes of thy liues blood, that I will make thee ſweat.

And not reſpecting the <hi>Souldan,</hi> but his infernall rage, hee ſtopt to the gallant youth with his fift raiſed aloft ſaying, ſtay, for without armour I will terminate thy demaund. Nothing did <hi>Roſabell</hi> feare him, but as he was ſtriking, he parted aſide, &amp; with his hand he ſtroke him on the left chéeke ſo braue a buffet, that hee tumbled at the <hi>Souldans</hi> feete at ſuche time as the valiant <hi>Bembo,</hi> and the gallant <hi>Aſſirian</hi> entred the hall, where ſéeing the hurlyburly went on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to knowe the cauſe, and ſéeing the Giant caſting blood through his mouth, and fier fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his eies, going againſt his aduerſarie, the <hi>Achayan</hi> with his couragious minde ſtept betwéen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing his ſword drawne, and ſaid kéepe foorth Knights, for before the <hi>Souldan</hi> this is vnſéemely.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:38"/>So ſoone as he entred the liſtes he cloſed his Beauer, &amp; ſaid to the Knights, for he ſuppoſed they had been all three againſt him: why now diſcourteous Knights come, and you ſhall ſée, how far better it had béen not to haue angred me: yet notwithſtanding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had pardoned your liues, which now the heauens ſhall no way ſaue from my handes, &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell ſword. On his part ſtept the valiant <hi>Bembo,</hi> and mildely to pacifie him, ſaid: Moſt puiſſant King, ſéeing this matter concerneth another, and not our ſelues, doe not refuſe to fight with a ſingle knight, for it is well knowen, this whole aſſembly is vnable otherwiſe to reſiſt your mighty ſtrength: and ſo I am of your ſide againſt the Knight of the Lyons in the ruſſet armour, ſomewhat did the valerous <hi>Bembo</hi> quiet him with his gentle wordes, neuertheleſſe hee vttered the vaunts that ſuch infernall fiends accuſtome, which béeing heard of the <hi>Greeke</hi> to anger him ſaid, that all the place heard.

forſt him to let fall the bridle out of his handes: hee was not ſlowe in ſeconding another on the ſide vnder his left arme, that it made him ſhake therewith, and helping him, with a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g thruſt ſtrake againſt his breſt, with ſuch force, as had not his armour been forged by ſo cunning an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer it had pierſt his body fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſide to ſide. It made him ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what looſe his breath, yet not ſo, but that he turned vppon him like a praying vulture, giuing him his anſwere ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his praiſe, that he thought himſelfe ſuffitiently ſatiſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for diſcharging his blow on his helme, euen to his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers head, he made him bend his, ſhedding much blood tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his viſor, he would haue giuen another, but the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his horſe made him looſe it, paſſing ſo farre forwarde that, as he would, he could not wound him.</p>
               <p>Somewhat aſtoniſhed did <hi>Sacridoros</hi> deare ſonne recouer himſelfe, beginning between them ſo equall a fight, that yf added admiration to the wondering ſenſes of the beholders. The which was without meaſure increaſed with the ſight of that incomparable furie, wherewith the twoo worthies met in the middle of that large place, on whom the millions of many gazing eyes were ſo fixt, that winke they durſt not, fearing in the meane time they would incounter.</p>
               <p>Vnto the God of his Father did the amorous youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himſelfe, which was of ſuch effect, that méeting with more horror then doe the angrye billowes of a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous Sea with the furie of contrarious windes, beate on the immoueable Rockes, the <hi>Pagan</hi> hit <hi>Lyrianas</hi> louer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt of his ſtrong ſhield, that hee loſt his bridle and his ſtirroppes, with moſt part of his ſaddle, caſting him backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes on the horſes crooper, in ſuch a traunce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew not whether on horſe-backe he were left or no, the which by the force of the incounter broke his backe, that falling to the ground <hi>Roſabell</hi> had no other ſhift but to ſet his hand on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaddle pummell, and leape of with great ligeritie, leauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place amazed at the incounter hee had made, for hitting the gyante in the middle of his great ſhield, it clearely pierſt it,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:39"/>
and ſtriking him a little belowe his left breſt, (as there the woundes are moſt perillous, to hinder the paſſage of his breath it was of ſuch effect, that making him a little wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it thruſt him with ſuch mightineſſe: that bearing him clean ouer ſaddle and horſe backe: it tumbled him headlong on the earth, making all the place &amp; people tremble with the fall. All the beholders, in ſpight of the <hi>Souldans</hi> command, and guard, with a generall voice applauded to the heauens the mightineſſe of the iealous Knight, for ſo they called the <hi>Greeke</hi> becauſe of his deuiſe. Scarſe fell the Gyant, when (though with great paine) he roſe, &amp; drawing foorth a mighty Courtelaxe, he went towards the warrelike Louer, that like a politike Knight prepared to proceede in that battel. But firſt he looked how his friend did whom he ſaw main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his fight, with no leſſe then the worldes ſtrength. It grieued him becauſe he ſawe him in the blacke longer winded, and quicker in his ſtrokes, though therefore the gallant <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> loſt no ground: for no leſſe then one of the worldes worthies he was reputed.</p>
               <p>But a while leauing them, together mett the Actiue <hi>Greeke</hi> with the fierce Gyant, diſcharging at once ſuch ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtrokes, that the fartheſt remoted towers of the Citie ſhooke with the blowe. His knees on the ground did the faire Louer of <hi>Liriana</hi> ſett in ſuch amazeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he knew not where he was: But he had giuen the Gyant a more venturous blow, for not reaching him on the head, he ſtrooke with his point cloſe to his throate, with ſuch ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that renting all the thickneſſe of his helme, with his neck-peece, it made him along wound, from whence iſſued great abundance of blood. A gelded Bull was neuer ſeene more fierce, then with his wound the <hi>Pagan</hi> did become furious, for roring againſt heauen, &amp; with thouſand iniuries reuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Gods, he began to brandiſh his Courtelaxe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch mightineſſe, that therewith he neuer reacht the youth, but he made him tremble like an Aſpen leafe, ſhaken by a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren winde. Among the many that he gaue him, he reſted
<pb facs="tcp:13977:40"/>
one to his content vpon his ſhield, that the fineſt of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnable to reſiſt that ſtrength, it was cut quite aſunder, &amp; ſo tormented the youths ſtrong arme, that through the paine he thought it loſt. His ſhield fell on the ground, &amp; his arme ſo hung downe, that euery one iudged it cut. Aſide ſtept the couragious <hi>Greeke,</hi> for the paine admitted nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>Well did the valiant <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> perceiue it which grieued him to the ſoule, doubting the ſucceſſe of the fight being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with ſuch cruell enemies. But deſirous to help his friend, becauſe the Gyant perceiued the effect of his blowe, followed him with a ſtrong thruſt, brauely puſht him in the backe from him, and ſpurring his good horſe, (then which none in the world mounted a better beaſt) he ſideling incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Gyant in ſo good a time, that he tumbled him at <hi>Roſabels</hi> feet, who loſt not that opportunitie: for as he fell (helping himſelfe a little with his painfull arme) he gaue him on the ſhoulders ſuch a blowe, that he pearſt it to the bone, leauing him ſomewhat breathleſſe. For the want of blood that from his wounds ranne. Neither was the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chayan</hi> ſo ſlowe, but with his bay he arryued vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Greeke</hi> faſter then immagination, and taking him ſomewhat bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with the Giant, he ſtrooke him backwards ſo fierce a blowe, that hee ſent him forwards euen where the Gyant was, and ſo their méeting was the cauſe he fell not, though he reſted ſore bruiſed. Alreadie was <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> come, who with ſuch furie laid on his Helme, that the ſparkes of fire which from it he ſtrooke, cinged all his yeallow feathered plumes, that like a deſpairer he did weare. He ſcapte not without recompence, for reaching at him with eager deſire to execute his blow, he cloſed ſo nigh him that he could not, ſaue only caſt his ſtrong arms about him, &amp; with his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ere he could helpe himſelfe or be ſuccoured, gaue him a troubleſome wound vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his left arme: with one leape was <hi>Roſabell</hi> with them, and ſo ſtrucke a downe right blow on the furious <hi>Bembo,</hi> that cutting away all his ſkirt on that ſide, he grieuouſly wounded him on the right thigh, which
<pb facs="tcp:13977:40"/>
forſt him to let his aduerſarie goe: and though it ſo well fell out, yet it grieued the hawghtie Gréeke to ſée the euill procéeding in that battle, and with what ſhamefull diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Greatly did he deſire that his were on horſe-backe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better to ſuccor his friend, whome he knewe to bee in ſome diſtreſſe: but yet he reſolued to hazard it at once. So he went vnto the <hi>Pagan,</hi> that like a bayted Bull did roare and warding a mightie blow, he ſtept in with his right foot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtriking him on the outward ſide, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> almoſt he cut his thigh cleane aſunder. Great was the noiſe throughout the place, and greater the doubt of the victorie: fiue woundes, and all verie dangerous hath the <hi>Pagan,</hi> two on his breſt, one in his throat, another on his ſhoulder, and the laſt on his thighe. All the field doth he bedewe with blood, &amp; hadd for all that wounded <hi>Roſabell</hi> in three places, and ſo tyred him that he was ſcarce able to ſturre. Hee cloſed with the Gyant on ſuch a ſudden, that amazedly he had verie neare throwen him downe, for as he had fore-thought it, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſomewhat lowe, and taking him betwéene his legs, he hadde almoſt rayſed aloft, but againſt his owne ſhoulders, did the Gyant ſtay himſelfe, and ſo both ſo long ſtriued that both fell downe togither. They were not on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground when the valiant youth with his poniard, would terminate that warre: But the <hi>Pagan,</hi> with all his ſtrength ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnatcht it out of his hand, wherewith he had there ſlaine him had not hee drawen the Gyant, with which either procured to end the others life. A happie ſtarre did here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Prince, for caſting himſelfe aſide he ſcapt the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the blow, hauing his armour but a little ſcracht ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. But he happening on a better place thruſt his to the middle into his belly, wherat w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a fearefull grone he looſed his aduerſary, &amp; both ſtept to their ſwords, but the Gyant being ſo weake could not moue about: which being noted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> youth ſeming to feare him gaue back, ſuffering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> to follow him, who was ſcarce w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in his reach, but drawing ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weaknes, he gaue him ſuch a thruſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had it bin w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more aduiſe, he had out-right kild him: yet reſted he not
<pb facs="tcp:13977:41"/>
without wounding, or receiuing the greateſt blow that in all that day he had felt, which falling on the toppe of his Helme, where not able to penetrate, it ſlyſte away all the brimme vnto the ſhoulder, where ſtaying with mightie force, it made him ſet his knees on the earth. Follow the blowe would the Gyant, but the youth knowing his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſet his ſworde long-wayes betweene them, which made him ſtaye, till he well recouered his feete. Alreadie was the <hi>Pagan</hi> through wearied, and ſo he would end that long laſting fight, with one blowe, which at his aduerſary he caſt: who aſſured of the perill, with a leape made him looſe it, togither with his life: for he fell vpon his owne ſworde, following the furie of his armes. The which no ſooner did <hi>Roſabell</hi> perceiue, but with both hands he laide vpon his left ſyde (and as there commonly the armour is weakeſt, he opened it euen to his entrailes, where he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe parted his heart, and giuing paſſage for his life, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a deſerued death, he flang him dead at his feete. Hee was not ſlowe in taking of <hi>Bollador</hi> that famous horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the dead Gyant, and mounted thereon at ſuch time as ſenceleſſe he ſaw his good friend, carryed about the field vpon his ſteede. Immeaſurable was the griefe that he conceiued, ſuppoſing him dead: and ſo he ſet himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtoute <hi>More</hi> (that followed him) ſaying: Stay Knight, for to ſtrike him that cannot defend himſelfe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diminiſheth then augmenteth the fighters honour.</p>
               <p>Mylde, and one of the courteouſt in the worlde, was the incomparable Louer, but he then was ſo cholericke, that ſtumbling on him, the aunſwere he gaue him was a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie blowe, which the <hi>Greeke</hi> ſo felt, that like an <hi>Aſpicke,</hi> he turned, ſeeing the diſcourteſie of his enemie, that with both handes he diſcharged on his inchaunted Helme ſo braue a blowe, that it ſounded like a bell, caſting him in a traunce along his horſe backe, ſhedding an infinite quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of blood through his mouth. Which when the <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> ſawe, and ſuppoſing, by his behauiour he ſhoulde be
<pb facs="tcp:13977:41"/>
his ſonne, he caſt downe his golden Scepter (fearing his life) ſaying, Knight haue done: for I yelde the battaile for this Knight, and alſo adiudge you both free thereof,</p>
               <p>Mightie Lorde (aunſwered the Prince) I do reioyce in my very ſoule, to haue this occaſion, that I may ſhewe part of the great deſire I haue to ſerue you, being by duetie bound thereto. And ſeeing there reſtes no more to doe, as alſo becauſe I and my companion (that alreadie was there) haue much to doe in another place, where wee be expected. Commaund my coſen the King of <hi>Garamantes,</hi> and his friends to be deliuered vnto mee: for wee can no longer ſtaye.</p>
               <p>That (replyed the <hi>Souldan</hi>) though you haue obtained, the victorie of the fight remaines to my diſpoſing, becauſe their fault was againſt my ſtate and Crowne, and ſo I wil ſee it corrected. Great is the wrong offered vs (ſaid <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>) and farre greater is it done vnto your owne perſon by vyolating your royall worde, which the meaneſt and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Knight would to his vtmoſt ſtrength procure to keepe. Your vnreuerence Knight is ſo great (replyed the <hi>Souldan</hi>) that it deſerues no other aunſwere, but the ſharpe puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that againſt ſuch as you the law in my kingdom doth allow. If that lawe agreeth with the firſt, touching your promiſe (ſayde <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi>) you may glorie to bee a wiſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator.</p>
               <p>Not farre was the royall guard, that ſeeing the Knights arrogancy, began to lay about them, determinng to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon them. Betweene them ſtept the valiant <hi>Bembo,</hi> deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Souldan</hi> to liberate the priſoners, the like did <hi>Don Clariſell,</hi> that reſted greatly affectionate to <hi>Roſabell.</hi> And ſeeing that not onely they would not deliuer the priſoners, but alſo offered violence vnto the Knightes, which their nobleneſſe not permitting, drewe foorth their ſwordes to helpe them: Which then was needeleſſe, for in the fielde were alreadie alone twentie thouſand diſguiſed, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the Kings were, had caſt them weapons, who
<pb facs="tcp:13977:42"/>
were not ſlacke in arming themſelues, for the tumult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan greatly to increaſe. Whereupon <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> ſet him ſelfe at the ſtaire foote executing wounders in their defence, giuing neuer a blowe, but was mortall, till the Kings deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and were mounted, which being done, the furious <hi>Greeke</hi> ſaid. It is no time now to fight valiant Princes, but only procure to follow me, for I being well acquainted with all the waies in the Cittie, will without danger ſafe-conduct you through it. As you will haue it (Sir Knight ſaid they) ſo be it done, though willingly we would let the <hi>Souldan</hi> know what iniuſtice he had done vs, another time will ſerue for that ſayd <hi>Roſabell.</hi> And ſo looſing the raignes of his <hi>Bollador,</hi> with both hands he cutt his paſſage through thoſe troopes in ſuch ſorte, that he which could faſter flie thought himſelfe moſt valiant. It was admiration to ſee how higher then his owne elbowes ouer horſe and all he was beſmeard with blood. With no leſſe courage followed <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> in ſome perill which was leſſened by the kings companie. In this order did they iſſue out of the Cittie leauing in it eternal memorie of their valour. The <hi>Souldan</hi> would haue had them followed: but the two Knights ſo handled the matter, that they pacified him, commanding the tumult to ceaſe, and perſwaded him to forget his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt the Kings: which he the ſooner did becauſe <hi>Don Clariſell</hi> gaue him a letter from <hi>Lupercio</hi> to thſs effecte.</p>

They ceaſt not till they came to the Sea-ſide
<pb facs="tcp:13977:43"/>
where the Kings had their fleetes ſtaying for them: for the gouernors of their kingdomes, being aduertiſed of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, had made that prouiſion to fetch them. So ſoone as from their horſes they had diſmounted the king of <hi>Gara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantes</hi> ranne to imbrace the Princes, and ſaide, while the others did the like. Magnificent and illuſtrious Knightes, the worthieſt that euer buckled on armour, how may wee in parte ſhewe the thankfulneſſe due for ſo many great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, that for our ſakes you haue vndergone? Wee can finde no ſatiſfaction ſufficient to equalize your merits, but that ye will imploy and commaund our perſons, and ſtates in any your ſeruice, as patrons and defenders thereof, which to vs will be immortal happineſſe, and yet ſhall we remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, conſidering your deſerts and our benefits receiued. But to make our ioyes compleat, let theſe Kinges and my ſelfe obtaine the fauour to knowe by whome wee haue our honours and our liues regained. It hath (moſt mightie Princes) bene ſo little (replyed <hi>Roſabell</hi>) what this Knight and my ſelfe for you haue done, that (reſpecting your many merites) no occaſion may thereby be taken to fauour vs. But if you will do it, you do perfourme the honour that ſhal inlarge your fames, becauſe the ayde that my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and I receiued, was of power ynough to binde our liues to your laſting commaund: and ſo may you vſe vs as the onely procurors of your content.</p>
               <p>Touching your laſt requeſt, we are of ſuch remoted cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It pleaſed his Fortune ſo to fauour me, as to miniſter occaſion for our meeting, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many yeares ſince wee contracted a firme league of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolated amitie, which hitherto we haue maintained: and becauſe I made him partaker of my woes, and how the cauſe of them was the Princeſſe of <hi>Niquea,</hi> he promiſed

               <p>Whereupon he tould them the maner of her taking away, as is ſet down in the end of the firſt booke of this third part. Greatly grieued the Kings for the Ladies loſſe, chiefly for the Knights ſorrowe, but being vnable to redreſſe it, they comforted them as became true friendes of their qualities. And ſeing that the Kings longer ſtaying in that land would bee daungerous, they counſelled them to depart vnto their owne countries. From whence they might obtaine a peace from the <hi>Souldan.</hi> They all liked well thereof, and ſo they tooke their leaues of their friends, taking their right courſe to their kingdoms, where they got y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Souldans</hi> fauor, which prooued not a little coſtly to <hi>Grecia:</hi> For theſe Kings were they that moſt perſecuted her in her generall warres, as in the Fourth part at large ſhalbe related.</p>
               <p>Somewhat from the Hauen did the two valiant Princes lye themſelues downe to paſſe away the lingring paſſage of of the ſullen night, making their ſupper of ſuch prouiſion as <hi>Allirio</hi> had brought with him, which done, after a litle chat they parted a ſunder to ſléepe vnder the ſhadows of pleaſant ſmelling trées. A little more towards the Sea did <hi>Roſabell</hi> caſt himſelfe, who one while thinking on his Lady, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother on his voyage vnto <hi>Greece,</hi> not letting himſelfe to be knowen vntill his déedes might declare the Royaltie of his diſcent, lay tumbling on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graſſe, till he fell a ſléepe, which was ſo little that the Ecchoe of ſighing groanes proceeding from ſome that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained, were of force to waken him, who being of nature bould, and of nouelties deſirous, quickly ſet himſelfe on foote, and with his ſword in hand, went ſtraite to the place whence he heard the plaintes: and ſo going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little Meddowe, vnder the ſpreading of a towring <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi>

he ſaw a Knight in azure armour all ouer croſſe barred with Gold.

               <p>The extremitie of paſſions were ſuch and ſo many which ſurprized the louer, that not onely hindered his ſonge, but ſtopt his breath, accompanied with a ſuddaine fainting, that in a traunce leaft him ſpéechleſſe leauing againſt the <hi>Caedar</hi> but being paſt, he returned with a ſighe, (that I knowe not whoſe hart it would not mollefie,) but hers (oh pardon me) that is the ſwéete inſulting enemie of my life, and ſayd. Oh loue, how doeſt thou ſpare none from burning with thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſuming fier? Oh you mightie Princes, by fortune exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the higheſt top of honor, I nothing enuie your eſtates if once it be touched with loue? Oh Gods, how farre hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier (by enioyning a contented life) where I, yf I had the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a laboring Countreyman, and not the tytle of ſo great a Prince, that my ſtarres haue giuen mee? But oh cruell paſſions, &amp; more intollerable griefe, what, Oh yes, thither would you follow me hauing as great a power in a poore cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as in a Princes Court? And therefore ſeeing I muſt loue, and muſt liue thereby, I will admit no comfort: but what ſhall come from <hi>Roſaluyra,</hi> for the ſwéeteſt otherwiſe is but hatefull, ſower and abortiue? Oh deſpightfull cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Oh hap vnhappie, &amp; vnheard of that I ſhould loue, and not manifeſt it to the Empreſſe of beautie: and of my Idolatrie

the ſole Goddeſſe, and that I thus muſt languiſh without her knowledge? Well it muſt be ſo, ſhe will haue her will deſeruedly accompliſht, and I will remaine adoring, her more then euer was Lady loued? But in recompence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a thinge ſo ſmall as <hi>Trebatios</hi> head, is a diminiſhing of the high deſerts of her incomparable merits. By this way (oh Gods) to procure my content, I am reſolued to doe becauſe hers conſiſteth therein: But yet yf by my louing, and wéeping experience ſhe would be aſſured of my faith, my death in this enterprize were eternall felicitie.</p>
               <p>But oh ſlowe louer, and more baſhfull wooer, why doeſt thou linger knowing there is no other meanes for thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe? Intollerable and more then may be imagined is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g agaynſt thy Lady thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteſt, in this delay? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, with a ſudden haſt that in ſuch caſes happens, hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on his helme, had tooke vp his weapons, calling to his Squire for his horſe: But ere it was brought him <hi>Roſabell</hi> iſſued out of his ambuſh: For knowing the Knight to bee ſonne vnto the <hi>Souldan</hi> of <hi>Niquea,</hi> and brother to his deare Ladie, it grieued him becauſe he had vndertaken ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe againſt his Grandfather. The occaſion and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe thereof hee had tould <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> as hath been largly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the firſt of the ſecond part.</p>
               <p>And approching to the Knight, with a gallant audacitie he ſayd. By that I haue heard (ſir Knight) I haue vnderſtood you are <hi>Lindoriano</hi> Prince of <hi>Niquea,</hi> the Knight that I as my ſoule doe loue, and euen to the ſame it grieues mee you haue vndertaken a demaunde ſo perrilous as that againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Trebatio:</hi> for you muſt conſider how that Lady and her Mother rather procéede through hate then w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that bindes them to diſſemble it: And if <hi>Garrofilea</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of the Emperour, her ſelfe was the cauſe thereof, procuring to her honours coſt the accompliſhing of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And ſeing the Emperor did doe it, hee might no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſe becauſe the ſacred law of marriage did forbid yt: whereof ſhe was aduertized when ſhe had him in priſon, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13977:45"/>
ſo ſhe might content he ſelfe with the children ſhee hath of ſo mightie a Prince, and not topſey turuie turne and offend the world with her vanitie, &amp; méere follie, as to hope for hys head for hir reuenge? and well doe wee knowe that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans reuenge is but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of feruent deſire of things and things. None more then ſhe I am ſure would grieue with his death? becauſe with reaſon the loſſe of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might iuſtly be lamented by his Daughter <hi>Roſaluira,</hi> &amp; ſo ſhe ſhould caſt her fame and honour on the dice, being cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of ſo many deathes as haue already happened: for the world doth wel know there is none therin, that (againſt his will) is able to make that Prince leaue the liſtes. A greater honour were it for her to diſſemble her angrie loue, as dooth her ſonne <hi>Polliphebo</hi> who is reputed the flower Chiualrie, glorying in nothing more then of ſuch a Father, &amp; not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe her ſelfe his head, at whoſe countenance the very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens tremble.</p>
               <p>And ſo (ſir Knight) the great loue I beare you hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to this diſcourſe: becauſe with more immortall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by louing &amp; by your haughtie déeds ſhall you ſooner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine your Ladies loue, then by ſo doubtfull and vncertaine a meanes that can nothing yeild then a blot to your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Attentiuely did the Prince of <hi>Niquea</hi> heare him thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king he ſhould know him, and well noting his ſpéeches, &amp; perceauing hee grounded them vpon ſuffitient reaſon, was yéelding to his counſell: but ſurprized with the memorie of his Ladies commaunde, hee did reiect thoſe perſwaſions, becauſe he would bee obedient, and ſo ſhewing ſome anger, replyed thus.</p>
               <p>Truely (ſir Knight) I knowe not what you haue ſéene in me, nor in what diſtreſſe you haue ſuccoured mee, that now ſuruiuing, you ſhould with ſo large a diſcourſe ſtriue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me that there is difficultie, and the greateſt poſſible, to behead the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did I not reſpect that thou didſt ſay thou diddeſt, and doeſt loue me, I would make thée know, what twere to counſell him that requires
<pb facs="tcp:13977:46"/>
it not? I well perceiue (aunſwered <hi>Roſabell</hi>) thou ſpeakeſt with affection: but becauſe thou ſhalt knowe what thou haddeſt to doe, I defye thee from hence vntill the Sunnes approche vpon thy vnlawfull enterpriſe, that he which ſhall firſt looſe his ſaddle or any peece of his armour, ſhall be vanquiſhed, promiſing to perfourme what the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhall commaund, and ſo ſhall you reuenge your ſelfe. I am contented (ſaide the ſtout youth) that thou mayſte knowe I am able to terminate this deede. Then let this Knight that here commeth be the Iudge (aunſwered <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabell</hi>) poynting to <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> that came with <hi>Allirio</hi> that led the horſes to ſeeke for the Prince. Be it as you will haue it (ſaid <hi>Lindoriano:</hi> For he that can loue ſuch a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, knoweth how to aunſwere for her.</p>
               <p>Preſently did they declare the challenge vnto the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Prince of <hi>Antioche,</hi> who thereof was glad, becauſe otherwiſe the <hi>Niquean</hi> ſhould not ſcandalize the <hi>Emperour</hi> his Graundfather. On the beſt horſes that the vniuerſe did knowe, mounted the two Heroicke warriors, and in middle of the Meadowe, turned either againſt the other, and both together with an aſſured hope of victorie, though one muſt of neceſſitie be vanquiſhed. A thing worthie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration was it, to ſee that ſcarce they had turned their fyerie courſers, when through the Oakes, Elmes, and Ceaders, iſſued from the woods, <hi>Siluanus,</hi> attended with all his troope of <hi>Faunes</hi> and ſiluan dwellers, conſorted with all the deſert and Forreſt Nimphes: <hi>Glaucus</hi> with his <hi>Trytones</hi> left his waterie habitation: and all with one deſire to ſee that memorable combate had left their earth and water Cauernes. The heauens cleared their light more brighter then at ſuch times was their cuſtome, and in the ayre appeared <hi>Mars</hi> in his throne, and in another a little higher ſate <hi>Cupid,</hi> for both Gods might learne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in both ſciences, of the Warriors: becauſe if one is ſo, it is becauſe he loues: Whereof no experience can better approue it, then by a bloudie Combate: and both
<pb facs="tcp:13977:46"/>
gallants in thoſe Artes, are as ſkilfull as <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Cupid:</hi> and therefore was it no wonder they ſhoulde ſit as Iudges of ſo famous a battell. For the one leauing on the ſteeled ſhield forged by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and the other on the Coate of wiſe <hi>Mynerua,</hi> they expected the ſucceſſe thereof: when with more furie then the lightening paſſeth, they mett in the middeſt of the flowered Meadow, with ſuch an impetous noyſe, as if the two Thrones of both the Gods had fallen to the earth. Neither failed of their incounter, which were ſuch, and of ſuch ſtrength, that though then there no ſtarre did twinckle in the Firmament, yet fild they the ground with them. They paſt one by another with as much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, as the God of warre their heauenly Iudge could haue done. The <hi>Nyquean</hi> loſt one ſtirroppe, but ere he ſtayed it was recouered, turning vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his aduerſarie with his ſword, at one time giuing each other ſuch blowes that they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them ſelues according to the friendſhippe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did require. Fully reſted they aſſured of eythers valour, beginning one of the braueſt Battailes of the woorld, themſelues being of the valianteſt thereof. It greatly auailes the <hi>Nyquean</hi> to bée <hi>Lirianas</hi> brother, for the <hi>Greeke</hi> immagining thereon ſeemeth ſlowe in his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expecting ſome occaſion to cloſe with him, truſting on the ſtrength of his <hi>Bollador.</hi> This did not his aduerſarie perceaue, being more furious than a hunted Lion, and through the careleſneſſe he ſawe in his enemie, attributing it to weakenes, he had time (deſirous to end the warre) to ſtrike him inwards ſo troubleſome a blow, that hee could enter with his quicke horſe to wounde him with twoo thruſtes one after another, that eyther of them (had he not beene <hi>Roſabell</hi>) had ſlaine him outright: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hée caſte him along his Courſers crooper, and as with furie hee paſt, he could but weakelie ſtrike him ſidelong vpon the brimme of his helme, that it cut aſunder two buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and had he a little more ſtretcht forth his arme he had
<pb facs="tcp:13977:47"/>
chopt of his head. Now is there no time for courteſies, now doth he forget himſelfe, and in this agonie in great rage hee recouered his ſaddle, ſtaying for the Prince that returned in queſt of his pray. He let him come within him becauſe hee would not looſe his blow, but it was ſo much that he could hit him no otherwiſe then cloſe to his hilts with ſuch ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that from without, and within his helme hee fecht many a Thouſand ſquadrons of fierie ſparks that through the ayre went cracking like ſquibbes. He would haue caſt his armes about his necke, but hee was ſo nimble that ſpurring his horſe hee made him miſſe of his purpoſe, almoſt tumbling downe carried by the force of his armes, yet fell he vpon his horſe pummell.</p>
               <p>Well did <hi>Lindoriano</hi> note his amaze, and ſo followed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a floriſhing blow vpon his ſhoulders that he grieuouſly felt it: But it was to his euill for returning more fiercer then a Bazeliſke, caſting his ſhield behind his back with hoth his handes hee layde vpon his aduerſaries, that parted in two hee caſt it to the grounde, together with a péece of his breſt-plate, he trembled tike a ſhakened leafe, ſo did the Iudges, fearing at the ſight of ſo braue a blowe. He ſeconded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (for nowe is hee gouerned by rage, and not with the griefe that <hi>Liriana</hi> might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaue hearing of her brothers cruell vſage) which was in ſuch manner that caſting blood through his mouth, his horſe carried him about the fielde, follow him would not the galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Britania<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelfe to accompt, howe that was <hi>Lindoriano</hi> wyth whom he fought.</p>
               <p>Grieuouſly bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to chide himſelfe for his offence, ſo greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becomming penitent for the fault that while hee ſtoode onely imagining thereon, yt had like to haue coſt him his life, for the <hi>Nyquean</hi> returning to himſelfe, twixt both ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds rayſed his ſword aloft, making the hard earth tremble vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the paſſage of his horſe hoofes, and ſo at his pleaſure layd him on the helme that it dryued it downe, ſtryking awaye all the circuite thereof, it was not ſo waighty that ſenceleſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:47"/>
his ſteed bore him about the field he would not then vſe with him any courteſies, but ſturring his horſe followed him amaine, and with his ſword rayzed he thought at that blow to end that buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſight of this pittefull ſpectacle gauld the hawghtie <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> to the harte, yet durſt he not helpe his frende, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed Iudg. Notwithſtanding was <hi>Lindoreanos</hi> daſht in his intent for ere he arriued the braue <hi>Greeke</hi> had recouerd himſelfe, and ſeing his aduerſarie runne towards him gordged with deſire of the blowe, he ſtaied for him, and as he cloſed a little ſtept aſide with his good courſer that he was ſtruck but on the ſide of his ſhoulder and all that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was bruſed. Three howres is it ſince the battle begune and yet no aduantage betweene them was knowne. The field was ſtrewed with peeces of their armour that their blows did tare. By this the ſtreakes of light laced the vaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie heauens, as meſſengers of the approching morne: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Roſabell</hi> ſeeing the little he had done, and how much it concerned him, being a matter that ſo nearly towched his Grandfather, a quarter of an hower before the ſunne prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiated his dyurnall courſe, Iudging it weakeneſſe to lett a battle ſo long indure, he warded a heauie blowe the youth let flie at him: cloſed within him, where might there beſene one of the braneſt wraſles that the world euer ſawe: for their horſes more firmely fixing their hoofes on the ground then the rooted rootes of ſtrong oakes within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, gaue leaue vnto the combatants, to gaine aduantage in the loftie ayre.</p>
               <p>New maner of warre was this for the two that in one daie were inſtalde in the honored order of armes and chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſynes. But the dexteritie, the ſtrong ſallyes, the braue cloſures, and furious moouings, made apparance of more experience then they had. For both their ages co-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, amounted not to xl. yeares: and notwithſtanding ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed they enſamples of learning armes for <hi>Mars</hi> that on them gazed, and documents for the proudeſt to emulate.

But now with your fauours (for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them I dare not) I do enter in the relation of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous actes which were ſo memorable that <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> at large doth ſet them forth: the which hauing lefte their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted habitation, &amp; entring within the Sea of <hi>Greece,</hi> they had in ſight the worthie <hi>Zaſinthus</hi> Iſle ſituated right oppoſite to the <hi>Corinthian</hi> gulffe, where they learned how many trauailed to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empyre, againſt the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the braue tryumphes, that ſhould be made in the famous Citie of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In millitarie actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted the two brothers, &amp; thinking there better then in any other place they would be found by reaſon of the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded their ſhip to be guided to <hi>Arriſſa,</hi> a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſome thing remote from the Citie, where the eight day they arriued, and taking land, they entred through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grene Foreſtes, taking the next waye to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but firſt determined to linger thereaboutes the time that wanted for the feaſtes, which might be ſome vii. or viii. dayes. So their Fortune led them to paſſe away the night, hard by the place where the iealous <hi>Sarmatia</hi> bewailed her woes. For after ſhe had parted from <hi>Brandafidell,</hi> ſhe caſt her ſelfe from
<pb facs="tcp:13977:49"/>
her horſe lamenting her miſfortuns ſuppoſing that her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <hi>Oriſtides,</hi> had forſaken her to Loue <hi>Floralinda,</hi> wife to the Prince, <hi>Meridean.</hi> And they arriued at ſuch time that forced by a Ielous ſpleene ſhe ſaid.

Oh <hi>Cupid</hi> if this be one of thy blowes eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all harts, how is it poſſible thou ſhouldeſt be honored? or to thee appeale, why ſhold any as to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Soueraine Prince and Iudge of the earth? how wilt thou haue, that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall worſhippe and adore thee, if with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames thou plagueſt their tender harts? Apparent ſignes did I ſee in that valiant Prince to loue me, but more certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner haue I met in <hi>Greece</hi> that he abhorrs, me. Oh happie Land only to me vnappie, I blame not thee but curſe my ſtarres that doe oppoſe their influences to ruinate my glory? who would haue tould me thou ſhouldeſt be a ſepulcher to her that to thee came to ſeeke her life? O Gods how farre better had I done to ſplit my hart in <hi>Lacedemon</hi> with my deare friends ſwoord, then to come to ſo great miſerie in <hi>Greece?</hi> mightie will be the wrong I doe to Ladies when my death ſhall be publiſhed to haue been becauſe I was not beloued. But wretch that I am, why impute I in him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſin of diſloyaltie hauing to his owne coſt aſſured mée by milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie déedes his ſoule to be ſoly thine, then, rather procuring thy victorie then the conqueſt for himſelfe? And ſéeing it is yet doubtfull, I will cheriſh my ſelfe till I know it, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſo, not that I loued him without hope of like, but for the diſhonor I did thereby commit againſt my puritie, I will vpon my life execute the cruelleſt death y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ere the world was guiltie of in recompence of my raſh fooliſhnes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſo ill repaied.

Rather (replyed the <hi>Lacedemon</hi> Ladye) this proues you a freſh Scholler in <hi>Cupids</hi> ſchoole, ſeeing you ignorant what wrong is offered to the Ladye loued, publiſhing her ſecretes: For to immagine them is ſecrete treaſon, committed againſt her.

Oh that I knew your Miſtres, be aſſured ſhe ſhould not longer liue deceaued in her hopes, although I thinke ſhe doth not, yf this be not to her vnknowen, you ſpeake more then befits you (ſaid the haſtie <hi>Floraliza</hi>) and with more bouldneſſe then you ſhould, which belike our ſimple &amp; well meaning ſpéeches did cauſe, that rather is (anſwered <hi>Sarmacia</hi>) the trueſt teſtimony that any can haue of his Fortitude, and not the vaunting beaſts that many vſe, and commonly bragge of. And ſeing this way you haue brought it about, reſtore me the honour I did you eſteeming you in the degrée of a good Knight, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting due glorie to your ſeming merits: and when you haue ſo done then doe what you wil, for I giue you leaue. What I will haue (ſayd the angry Ladie) is to let you vndeſtand the diſcourteſie you haue committed, which is greater then the ſtrength you boaſt of. Then ſtay (replyed <hi>Oriſtides</hi> Lady) and you ſhall ſée how well I can ſhew the one, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dependes thereof, and ſo leaping on her light horſe, hee turned him about, defying her to mortall battle.</p>
               <p>In matters of warre woulde not the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe diſſemble with her brother, much more with whom ſhe knewe not, and did challenge her. Oh <hi>Appollo</hi> the deſire to ſee ſo braue a combate made thée haſten <hi>Auroras</hi> ſplendor to her wonted light, becauſe without thy preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce none could witneſſe their hawghtie déedes: or was it, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of thy <hi>Alceſtes</hi> loue thou wouldeſt ſurfeite on this beautie.</p>
               <p>Which ſéeing it ſo, why doeſt thou not dippe my dull penne in the <hi>Nectar</hi> of thy Diuinetie, for if they each other wouunde, this and my tongue muſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize it: Now is the ſeaſon thy liberall influence to impart with mee, when the whole worldes beautie is here like to periſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:51"/>There was left no Cittie in the firſt Heauen to guard their habitations, onely to be ſpectators, of ſo rich a fight, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them would willingly looſe their liues, to bee woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch beautie. They met by the ſwiftnes of their nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Courſers in ſuch manner, that the ſtrength of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters made the Brother ſhrinke at the viewe. No harme happened betwéen the Ladies moſt gallantly paſſing by ech other: &amp; their méetings ſerued but in ſhéeuers to ſende their launces through the emptie ayre to <hi>Phaebus</hi> middle Manti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At once drewe they the two admirable ſwords the one of <hi>Camilla,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> by ſucceſſion. Come to <hi>Oriſtides,</hi> who gaue it to his deare <hi>Sarmacia</hi> in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> as the preſident booke reported. With them hoyſted on high together did they ground them on their helms, reſting either alike aſſured of the others ſtrength, for the Heauens had in fortitude and beautie in euerie reſpect equald them. They began one of the fierceſt battailes that the world did euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, for being Ladies increaſing in wrath, their blowes were able to diſſolue a Rocke: But ſuch were their ſtrong armours, that it aſſured them from all perils. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe with ſuch furious ſtrength they layd vppon each other, that the fleſh more fairer then <hi>Venus</hi> in her chiefe pride, they mangled. The deſperate <hi>Sarmacia</hi> gaue her gallant enemie a dangerous blow a little belowe her Beuer: it was to no ſmall effect, for it made her bend her head below her Horſe maine. She would not omit the aduantage, for ſieldome like to this there happens none, and ſo with both hands ſhe layd on the circuite of her helme, that ſhee ſtruck her from all féeling, made her blood run through her viſor and mouth, looſing the guiding of her horſe, which ſenceleſſe bare her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the fielde a good while, till, recouering her ſelfe, (the rage that with furie ioyned to ſettle her firmly againe in her ſaddle is not ſet downe) for caſting her <hi>Romaine</hi> ſhielde at her faire backe, ſhe let flie at her helme with ſuch ſtrength, that had ſhe carried her arme ſtiffe, that blow had termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:13977:52"/>
the controuerſie. Notwithſtanding the blad vnable to penetrate the magick temper, it went ſlyding downe the ſame falling on the ſhoulder, lighting ſo heauily that ſhee thought all that quarter had been beate aſunder. She fell with her breſt on her ſaddle pummell, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weyght of the ſtroake, the horſe ſet both his knées on the earth.</p>
               <p>Scarſe had ſhe executed this blow, when (worthy with admiration to be celebrated) at the wounded <hi>Sarmacias</hi> ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſhee helped her with two thruſtes one after the other, with ſuch force that her owne handes trembled therewith, caſting her aduerſaries head vpon the horſe croopper, ſhee would cloſe with her to ouerthrowe her with her Steede, but with this deſire ſhe ſpurd hers with more force then née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for it made him furiouſly paſſe further then ſhe would, that ſtumbling on her aduerſarie, ſhe had like to fall which to preuent, ſhe nimbly leapt from her owne to the ground. It was aduiſedly done: for the <hi>Lacedemon</hi> Ladye arriued with a ſtroake in ſuch blinde furie, that had ſhe met her ſhe could not but haue incurred certaine danger: For not mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her the blowe fell in middle of the ſaddle deuiding it, &amp; the horſe in two. Tremble did the Prince with the ſight of this blowe, iudging the Knight of mightie valour, in no leſſe reputation did the aduerſe Ladie accompt him, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in ſome amaze, lying along the horſe necke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the winde of the blowe, with a leape ſhe ſtept thyther, &amp; caſting her ſtrong armes on her, ſhee ſnatcht her from the ſaddle, and ſéeing her in ſome confuſion therby becauſe one foote hung in the ſtirrope, which ſhee could not take foorth, ſhee ſo ſtriued that ſhee pluckt her dagger from her backe.</p>
               <p>Hereat the hawghtie dame ſéeing her diſgrace feared a ſudden death diſhonourable, and ſo ſhee had no other remedie, but looſing her ſworde with all her ſtrength to drawe her to her, and ſtrongly ſetling her ſelfe on one foote ſhe did in ſight of her aduerſaries brother a thing worthy her beautie, for caſting her arme at <hi>Floralizas</hi> dagger,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:52"/>
ſhee drewe it out of the ſheath and with it hadd ſlaine <hi>Alicandros</hi> vnknowne Neece, yf ſhe had not ſtept away with feare ſeeing her owne weapons in her aduerſaries handes: It was no little good fortune, for the valerous <hi>Sarmacia,</hi> hauing thereby time to drawe her foote out of the ſtirrope, and with hard plucking ſhee had almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynted: which founde to her griefe, for going to follow her enemie ſhe could not treade thereon, which was the cauſe ſhe had almoſt fallen on her. She diſſembling yt as much as poſſible ſhe might, expecting her enemies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: which was not longe, for like a chaffed Lyoneſſe (ſeeing that was her firſt battle, and what little honor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe ſpéedily did finiſh it ſhe ſhould get) ſhe flung againſt <hi>Sarmacia,</hi> and with both handes ſhe layde on her ſo thicke, and ſo quicke that breathleſſe ſhee hadde almoſt tyred her, and yet ſhe hawghtlie defended her ſelfe, often ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Floralindas</hi> daughter reſt on the grounde both wyth handes and féete, till the paine of her foote was paſte, and then ſhe ſeemed but newly to begyn the combate, for the ligeritie wherewith ſhee entred and ſalyed deſerued admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>With a floriſh they croſſed aloft their putting ſwordes procuring that way to conclude their warre: But it laſted not long, for <hi>Alicandros</hi> Néece, thruſting her ſomewhat more inwards, ſtepping in with her right foote, and with imagined ſwiftnes ſhe gaue her a venturous blowe, for taking her vnder the ſkirt it wounded her though little on the thigh. It was no newe matter for the Ladye, to receaue ſuch blowes, it made her looſe her patience, and like a rauenous Vulture did ſhee become with the ſight of her owne blood.</p>
               <p>Nowe ſeeke they no ſlyght no warde, nor no agilitie to defende and offend, but onely committe the hazarde of their Lyfe or Death to the ſtrength of their armes, and with the vttermoſt force that <hi>Sarmacia</hi> hadd poſſeſt
<pb facs="tcp:13977:53"/>
with <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> blade twixt both handes, ſhee layde on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe helme, making her with the force of the ſtroake to ſet her handes on the grounde, which ſhee had not done when another was redoubled with no leſſe furie, lighting on her ſhoulders,, which ſhe extreamely felt. More nimble farre, and more vſed to toyle then was <hi>Horaliza,</hi> was the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Ladie, and ſo looſing her ſhield and ſworde ſtayed till ſhe roſe, and ere ſhe ſetled her ſelfe, cloſed with her, caſting her right arme with ſuch force twixt her legs, that ketching her ſome-thing ſuddenly, ſhe raiſed her from the ground, and with a great fall caſt her on the earth: But as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens amonge the wraſtling challengers at the <hi>Olympicke</hi> games, ſo fel it out betwéen theſe Ladies: For by how great the fall is, by ſo much the more it ſtrengneth the vnder ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recouer his loſt aduantage, by amendment of his foyle: euen ſo was it heere, becauſe as ſhee caſt her on the grounde, and both fell on their ſides, the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Lady found opportunitie by a ſudden ſcape to ketch warlike <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macia</hi> vnder.</p>
               <p>There perceaued <hi>Horaliza</hi> that ſhee had occaſion by the front through ſo venturous a fal, and ſo ſhe ſet her knées vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her, and becauſe ſhe had no dagger, for it had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from her, ſhe caſt her ſtrong arms about her, for it was all ſhe could. The Ladies were ſo tyred with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former toile y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this preſent labour left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breathleſſe: for after they had thus contended a long houre, without ſence they ſtretched themſelues vppon the earth, to <hi>Celindos</hi> great ſorrow, who alinghting from his horſe went to his deare Siſter, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing her helme found all hir face beſmeared with blood, &amp; pale like aſhie Death. His hart trembled when ſo he ſawe her lye, and leauing her that the aire might breath on her, he went to ſee what Knight the other ſhoulde bee, that had the power ſo to vſe his Siſter: and when he alſo ſawe ſhe was a Lady, with a ſhaking cold ſweate was all his bodye coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But this was not through any newe paſſion, but for the remembrance of <hi>Roſiluera,</hi> which he ſawe portrayed in

The which ſtraight vaniſhed, for beginning to ſtur, they ſhewed happy newes of their liues. He would not ſo leaue them, for it might be occaſion of new quarrels, and ſo taking his Siſter before him, (becauſe hee would not leaue ſo valiant a Lady without a horſe) hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her within the Forreſt to ſee if he could finde any place where ſhee might haue the rootes of her hayre cured on her head. For elſe, woundes had ſhe none becauſe her armour did defend it. And méeting with no place they were faine to alight there, bringing water from a cleare ſpringe (whoſe current that way ran into the Sea, paying his Tribute to the <hi>Ocean</hi>) he caſt it on her face, till ſhe recouered her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And ſeeing her ſelfe in that manner ſhee thought ſhee had béen by her aduerſarie vanquiſht.</p>

At this time came the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror from his pallace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch maieſtie as he ſeemed a God on earth: For their horſes, coches, chariots and attendants were numberleſſe.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:55"/>He paſt the place with gallant diſpoſition, brandiſhing his launce in a thouſand peeces, and comming to the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where the Ladies were, he ſaid.

Great was the noiſe that in the place was made, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ioy, that the Ladies conceiued, ſeeing how well their Knightes performed it.

That muſt be (ſaid the other) as the Iudges pleaſe, who ſeeing the controuerſie, went to them, and adiudged the aduenturer vanquiſhed. Whereupon the ſhrill ſound of Trumpets was ſo great, that the one could not heare the other. The ſmoke that iſſued from the Ordinance darkened the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Sunnes brightneſſe, that in the middeſt of his courſe ſtoode to beholde the Iouſtes.

And ſeeing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good occaſion to ſpeak vnto his Lady, he ſaid:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:57"/>I am glad (ſoueraigne Queene of <hi>Lyra</hi>) that you haue graunted what my Lady mother hath noted, which is no ſmall comfort to thoſe that pyne, to knowe that all the fault is not in the gallants, but ſome alſo in their Ladies diſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours or diſgrace. It is not ſo great (replyed the ſharpe Quéene) as it is iuſt towards thoſe Knightes, that without conſideration place their hopes, on that which yeeldeth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt cauſe of diſpaire. And then this is rather a fauour for which Ladies ought to be gratified, when ſo plainly they leaue their louer hopeleſſe, that after they call it not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, ſeeing their faith, loue, and loyaltie ſo ill repaide, and ſo ought their complaints to be pittied and excuſed, had not our ſtrangeneſſe at firſt diſwaded them. Wherefore (cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Prince) if any Ladye hath had more power ouer you, then all we on the Prince of <hi>Percia,</hi> thinke that your diſfauours proceeds from this: The wofull louer had not the ſtrength to aunſwere her, ſeeing how openly ſhe would not ſhewe him no hope of fauour. From thence he went to his chamber, ad vttering a thouſand exclaims he caſt him ſelfe vpon his bed, curſing his Fortune that ſo was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt his content. He durſt not tarrie long, becauſe he knewe his mother would ſend for him, ſo he returned &amp; placed himſelfe next to <hi>Oliuea,</hi> that loued him as her ſelfe, &amp; this was at ſuch time, as through the place entred two Knights armed in Ruſſet, with barres of black, that euery one enuyed their diſpoſition, but ſeeing they loued, &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deuiſes, that it was in ſome high place, it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to know they liued vnbeloued. Yet that was not the cauſe thereof, but the loſſe of their deare Ladies: For theſe were the valiant Princes of <hi>Celandia,</hi> that hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their leaues of <hi>Roſabell</hi> tooke their way towards <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi> Their deuiſe was a fierie Chariot, wherin their Ladies were caried away, &amp; they looking after them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this <hi>Motto:</hi>

                  <hi>Perſians,</hi> who taking a bigg launce, incounted the one ſo rigorouſly, that though on his feete he made him touch the ground, he loſt his ſtirrops: for fewe blowes like that he had receiued and paſſed forwards. Againſt him ſetled himſelfe the elder brother. This Knight was of more ſtrength, and ſo with more might they incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, ſhiuering their Launces in a thouſand pieces. The aduenturer loſt one ſtirrope, yet was it ſcarſe diſcerned. With new Launces they returned, but in this ſecond car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, the <hi>Celandian</hi> got but little, for his length on the earth he left with the fall.

Rightly haue you ſpoken (ſaid the Queene of <hi>Lyra</hi>) but in the liſtes to ſhewe the freeneſſe of his hart, this Knight deſerued not ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a fauour. She ſpake it, to let <hi>Claridiano</hi> vnderſtand that ſhe deſired to haue him Iouſt: but not ſeeing him there, ſhe ſtraight ſuppoſed that her ſharpe aunſwere had driuen him thence. It gréeued her, for ſhee loued him dearer then her ſelfe: But her grauitie was ſo great, that ſhe would by no meanes haue him imagine any ſuch thing of her: yet if to diſſemble were to loue, this Lady may be eternized for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous louer, and the greateſt that euer was.

The Knights abaſhed returned the waye they came leauing the place merrye, for the Ladies alowd did ſaie. Wel befall ſo amorous Knights, for it is Iuſt that ſuch as they do looſe their right to make the Ladies ſport. In this manner ieſted they when through one ſide of the place appeared a Knight, of haughtie diſpoſicion, for beſides the riches of his armour, his gallant behauiour and braue conſtitution, all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders admyred his armes were tauny of coulour with many greene Emeraldes that they ſeemed there to groe, all the Ioynts were of a ſiluer colour, and euery one Iudged him of valour, on his ſheeld in a tauny field was figured y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> picture of a Ladie whoſe beauty drew all eies vnto her.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:58"/>It is not credible how the comming of the amorous ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer pleaſed, who giuing his horſe the ſpurres, made him ſwiftly paſſe euen to the Ladies Theater, where curuetting made him bend his head betweene his legges, and himſelfe bowed his own lower then his ſaddle pumell, in ſuch braue manner, that no hart could more deſire. Some courteſie did the Ladies ſhew him, reſting verie fearfull that he woulde winne the prizes: With freſh horſe iſſued from the pauilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the couragious <hi>Perſian,</hi> and departing one againſt the other, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midſt of their carrier they met with more power then euer <hi>Mars</hi> was maiſter of. The adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turers armor was of a Magicke temper, &amp; therefore was the blow he receiued nothing ſeene, but that which he gaue the Maintainer was ſuch, that piercing his ſhield &amp; armes, with a little wounde he thruſt him ſo hard, that he caſt him behinde the ſaddle, &amp; plucking the Launce to him, with the furie thereof the horſe eleuated himſelfe, which was the cauſe (though on feet) that he went to the ground. Great was the rumour in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place with the ſight of the aduenturers braue blowe, raging like a furious Lyon, the iniuried French man entred the liſtes, aſſured to reuenge his friend, which iſſued otherwiſe then he thought: for the Tawnie Knight in power exceeded him. And ſo ending their courſe within their Speares length, ſo mightie was the incounter that the French Prince and his horſe with his Helme broken, tumbled to the earth. The aduenturer in the beginning ſeeing his ſtumbled forwards like to fall, verie nimbly leapt from him, and being quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with like ligeritie remounted on his backe. Oh God (ſaid the Empreſſe <hi>Claridiana</hi>) what valour is this of yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knight, beleue me not, if the prizes are not like to be his?

               <p>From this talke were they driuen by the comming foorth of <hi>Troylus</hi> Nephew, whoſe incounter was not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt: for ouer along the ſaddle it layde the head of the valorous

               <p>Verie few Knights were there in the place but by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe knew for what the Knight came. The Prine of <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quea</hi> did not ignore it, for remembring what he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Roſabell,</hi> ſeing him approch vnto the Theater, knowing his demaunde left his pauillion, and went thither. And the other being there come lifting vp his Beuer demaunded that euery one might heare. Who is here the Emperor <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio,</hi> for among ſo many no maruell if I know him not? I am hee ſir Knight (replyed the Emperor) therefore ſaye on what you require? For what I come, (Emperor) I am ſure wil gretly grieue thée, for only thy head hath brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far countries, which I muſt haue, becauſe thou wel knoweſt how thou haſt wronged <hi>Garrofilea</hi> Quéene of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacria,</hi> the which being ſo notorious, thou haſt no more to ſtay, but fetch thy armor, for here in her behalfe to mortall battle I defie thée. Truly knight thou ſayeſt well (anſwered the Emperour) for thy demaunde doth grieue me, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, verie much, not to refuſe the battaile, (for that ſhall ſtraight bee perfourmed) but becauſe it is in time of ſuch pleaſures. He that hath ſo manye enemies (replyed the proude <hi>Pagan</hi>) ought with feare to looke for none other.</p>
               <p>Before him ſtepte the moſte couragious <hi>Lyndoriano,</hi> whoe praying lycenſe of the Emperour, and obtayned,

turned to the <hi>Pagan</hi> with theſe woordes. It ill beſéemes thée Knight, were it onely for the Ladies ſakes at this time to come with ſuch a demaunde, which cannot but greatlye diſcontent them. And ſo in their names I ſay you haue ill done, and that you are vnworthie of what you doe procure, vpon all which I doe defie you. Like to an <hi>Hircanian Tyger</hi> the forayner replyed. Were I not ſo ſure of reueng I could not but reſt diſpleaſed with thy diſcourteous wordes. Thy battle I accept hauing finiſhed the Emperours. Why how now proude and inſolent Knight (ſayd <hi>Lindoriano</hi>) thinkeſt thou to vanquiſh him, whom <hi>Iupiter</hi> dares not in Heauen confront? our battle muſt bee ſtraight, for after thou ſhalt haue time for that, vnleſſe that hatefull of thy owne lyfe wilt preſently looſe it. Be it as thou wilt (anſwered the fierce <hi>Pagan</hi>) for being ſo neare the fielde wee may eſchewe vain ayrie wordes. Returne they would into the liſtes, but the Emperour commaunded the combate ſhould be left till the morowe. So they all departed leading their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayner out of the place with great honour, &amp; no leſſe trayne, who ſeing it to be time, returned to his pauillion, expecting the Sunnes vpriſe, where what happened, the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall recompt.</p>

The warlike Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi> came all armed, deſirous to breake ſome Launces, and ſo would not mount on the Theater. Her armour was no leſſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, then her beautie adorned with many Carnation flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of gold, that ſo well ſemed as euery one bleſt her with many millions of benedictions, ſo did the afflicted <hi>Claridia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorrowfulleſt in the world, did ſet himſelfe where none might ſee him the better to ponder on the immagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cauſes of his griefe, occaſioned by her that ouer-ruled his deſires.

               <p>Now Knight ſeing the time for déedes is come, there is no reaſon to delaye it, but in naming of the Iudge. Since the one of vs, muſt of neceſſitie remaine for euer breathleſſe in this fielde, that queſtion was néedeleſſe (replyed the <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quean</hi> Prince,) neuertheleſſe I nominate that Lady, whom thou procureſt to content with a head ſo honorable.

<pb facs="tcp:13977:62"/>
but ſeing the matter is in this eſtate, I name the ſame La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, for preſenting her with thy head and the Emperors, ſhe ſhalbe aſſured of the great reaſon ſhe had to ymploy mee in her ſeruice. Anſwere would not the furious youth thinking thereby he ſhould too long prorogue the warre, ſo they turned their horſes, which ſwifter then two light Gallies borne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the furie of their full winde blowen ſayles, met in the end of their courſe breaking in péeces their launces, whoſe ſhiuers mounted higher then the raging region of the ayre. Of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious ſtrengtht were the warriors and ſo their launces no more mooued them then hadde they incountred ſeuerall rocks, eyther returned to themſelues ſwelling with poiſon, and like rauening Lyons againſt their aduerſarie, &amp; draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foorth their glittering blades at once they gaue each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch blows, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one thought they were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt. Gret abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of blood yſſued through <hi>Lindorianos</hi> mouth, which he thought would be a hinderance vnto his battle, he layde the <hi>Pagan</hi> on the toppe of the helme, that he made him and his horſe ſtaggar aboue Ten paces back from him: Neuer was there ſeen a deuouring Harpie mory ſwift then did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> louer of <hi>Roſaluira</hi> follow the amazed King, giuing him thrée blowes one after another, that at euery one he made him ſée more ſtarres then the Firmament contayned. The beſt ſwoord of the fielde was the youthes, for it belonged to <hi>Artarax</hi> the firſt <hi>Souldan</hi> of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> he that in one day wold wyn thrée general pitched battailes, for which cauſe he gaue no blow, but threwe armour, and ſometimes fleſh vnto the ground.

                  <hi>Moore,</hi> &amp; croſſing aloft his ſword more quicker then imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he thruſt him with a point ſo ſtrongly, that a little he droue him from him, yet not ſo much but he could reach him with a counterbuffe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knée that it fetcht blod, tremble did the blowe make him, but abandoning all feare, as alſo of his life, hee recloſed with him, &amp; as his ſword had no fault, he laid on his left ſhoulder, &amp; ſliding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, it cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way al his elbow armor with his male ſléeue drawing much blood.

Oh who hadd at that inſtant ſéene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two warriors w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſhields, receauing their furious blows without warding. They began with cunning to procéed, for the <hi>Pagan</hi> as from death ſhunning the cutting blade, would againſt it ſhew his nymblens, ſo, well firming his leggs, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted his enemy, but his ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding did not continue, for the <hi>Nyquean</hi> entring w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both his, driued him from it, yet not ſo, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other might giue him ſo grieuous a ſtroake, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it made him ſet his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on the earth. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pagan</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> both hands giuing him another (it was a miracle it kild him not outright) for taking him on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waff where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armor is buckled it cut his ſkirt, euen to the fleſh, and a little more ſtrengthning his arme that place being the weakeſt he had ſlaine him, without paiment would he goe his waies, but it was not poſſible, for the <hi>Nyquean</hi> already inflamed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rage, as he paſt (deſirous to make himſelfe ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds) thruſt at him
<pb facs="tcp:13977:63"/>
with his point: he could not miſſe him, for lighting on his right thigh, he ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him ſtagger foure or fiue paces backe, he could not giue it with force, for otherwiſe hee had cut it. They returned as they but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fight, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the behoulders, that as a dreame they iudged it, for foure howers continued their combate without anye reſt. Affectionated to the Knight of the Ladies were they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and therefore greater was their feare of him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the thing loued (Beauties miracles) is reſpected w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt care. They parted a little to breath, and the <hi>Nyquean</hi> hauing time, began to recompt with how many things hee diſcharged the duetie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his honor had bound him, to ending wel that battle, and thinking that he had the worſt, he loked towards the Theater, confirming his doubt by the pittifull ſorrow that the Princeſſes ſhewed, and calling himſelfe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that a battle ſhoulde ſo long laſt him, not reſpecting how little he had breathed, furiouſly he reſaulted him at the inſtant that the other left his ſtanding to doe the like, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither through the mightines of their armes, the one layde his hands, and the other his knées on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. They were ſo nighe that they could not but caſt their armes about their bodies, preſſing them with ſuch force that they came to the earth, where who vp, and who downe, they ſtriued a good while in a ſtronge and dangerous wraſtle. The King no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gained thereby, for he was wounded mortally in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and ſo loſt much bloode, whereby his faintneſſe was plainely perceaued, the which was not in <hi>Lindoriano,</hi> for though he was bruſed &amp; weake, yet was it not for want of blood. They returned vnto their ſwords, but euidently was the maintayners aduantage knowne, which made the ſpectators begyn a new ioy, for the <hi>Pagans</hi> demaund had angred them all.</p>
               <p>The acknowledgment of his aduantage was not ſo great but that the other might recouer it, to the louers deare coſt, wearying him with aſſaulting, auoyding, warding and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. The people in the place celebrated euery blowe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:63"/>
with promiſes aboue the ſkies. But the impatient <hi>Moore</hi> blaſpheming againſt his gods, as thinking that his diſgrace from them proceeded, went to his enemie, and with both hands let flye at him ſuch a blowe, that lighting on the ſide of his Helme, he cut away all the buckles of the right ſide, which had he ſpyed, no doubt but he had made an end of him by againe recharging there. But he with-held ſo long that the gallant Louer recouered himſelfe, and with both armes aloft marched againſt his enemie, who in like ſorte met him, and with more horror then the furious waues beate vpon the flintie rockes, they diſcharged their blowes vpon their Helmes with ſuch puiſſance, that both ſenceleſſe fell on the ground: the <hi>Nyquean</hi> without his Helme, but the <hi>Pagan</hi> with his head, ſcull, and braynes broken, &amp; ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered within his owne. The people would haue gone to them, had not the guard ſtayed them, till they ſawe what became of the Knights traunce. But ſtraight was the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie proclaimed: for the valiant <hi>Lindoriano,</hi> returned and ſeeing him ſelfe in that manner, flung to his weapons, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault his foe: but ſeeing him ſo lye, went to him and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced his Helme, ſaw his head broken in three or foure pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it grieued him, for he was but yong, ſcarce hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beard. But ſeeing he could not doe withall, demaunded the Iudges, if he had accompliſhed to his honour. And in ſuch manner (replyed they) moſt valiant Knight, that for euer ſhall your memorie here indure. Alreadie came the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and all the Kings that were with him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Knight, who knowing which he was, proſtrated himſelfe vpon his knees, requiring his royall handes to kiſſe them, he would not do it, ſaying: He that hath them ſo good (Sir Knight) with more reaſon ought his to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, then ours giuen, and rayſing him from the ground verie kindly imbraced him, demaunding, who he was: he replyed, excuſing himſelfe the beſt that he coulde: ſaying that, for that time he was called <hi>Venus</hi> Knight The Emperour would not ſuffer him to ſtaye in the Tent, but
<pb facs="tcp:13977:64"/>
that he ſhould be cured in court. Where the Empres <hi>Bryana</hi> in company of all the Ladies (in recompence of what for the Emperor he had done) viſited him which from death reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, to giue it him more ſweeter with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. The Iouſtes ceaſed (by the Emperors commandement) for eyght daies while the Knight was in cure, where he was ſo much made of, as if they knew him in eſtate to be one of the greateſt Princes of the world.

Great comfort was it to him, the remembrance of the Nymphes promiſe: for that was only
<pb facs="tcp:13977:65"/>
what nouriſhed his life, which elſe he had him ſelfe from himſelfe bereft. None loued as he, and therefore was his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward admirable. In this manner traueld he, til the ſecond houre in the after-noone, that he ſawe comming towardes him a Ladye in company of one of the beſt proportioned Knights that he had ſeene. He was ſo loden with fearfull weapons, that he iudged him of great valour. And ye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, this is our affectionated <hi>Brandafidell,</hi> that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring howe the feaſtes were begun, was going towardes the Citie. So ſoone as they confronted ech other, raiſing his Beuer, he ſaid: If you come from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> Sir Knight, can you tell me who maintaines the Iouſtes, and whether they be begun. I onely know (replyed <hi>Don Eleno</hi>) that certainly they are begun, and as for the reſt, I haue heard the maintainers are the Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> in companie of him of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and the Troyan <hi>Oriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> Then belike (ſaide the Gyant) aſſured are the Gréeke Dames to looſe no part of their beauties.

And ſeeing I haue ſatiſfied your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, you ſhould do me a great fauour, to tell me newes of a Knight in white Armour, &amp; on his ſhield a Sanguine heart, with the like deuiſe that I haue? Yeſterday about this time (replyed the Gyant) we met him in greateſt haſte of his mightie horſe, and to mee the ſpeaking to him was coſtly: for being about to offer him my perſon to aide him, if he had neede, he went verie Cholericke: for ſharply hee aunſwered me. Well did I note it. Yet notwithſtanding, I ſet my ſelfe in middle of the way to ſtaye him with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter he did not ouerthrow me, but it was the greateſt, that in all my life I receiued. The heate of the Sunne ſomewhat annoyed the gallant Louer, and therefore he rayſed his Beuer. It was not ſo ſoone done, but the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant thought verily it was his deare <hi>Roſicler.</hi> (For as it
<pb facs="tcp:13977:66"/>
is ſaide, he ſo much reſembled him, as the one ſcarſe was knowen from the other,) and crying out alowde, he leapte from his beaſt, and flinging at the Prince ſaide: Oh, my deare Lorde, what good Fortune hath awayted thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Brandafidell,</hi> bringing him to ſee you. Thither was the beauteous <hi>Floralinda</hi> come and ſaide: Why, how now Soueraigne Prince, is it poſſible that in your owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey you will not know vs? Deedes are thoſe that <hi>Floralin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> hath receiued, that byndes her to your knowledge: but you are ſo changed, that I will complaine vnto the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> of your diſquietneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Eleno</hi> was ſo amazed at what the Lady and Gyant did, that he could not aunſwere, till he perceiued their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, taking him for his couſin <hi>Roſicler,</hi> ſo altogether liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his Beuer replyed. Moſt beauteous Ladye, to inioy ſo great fauour, as to that famous Prince you doe, I wiſh I were in deede him whome I do ſo much reſemble. I am not that Prince you knowe, though you may accompt me for your friend, as I thinke he is. I am his couſin <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia,</hi> and account it my good Fortune, to haue met with your company, and haue vnderſtoode of that Knight, that ſome fewe dayes hath made mee ſeeke him about theſe deſert Woods. And ſeeing I haue no more to doe, I commit you to God. For euery Minute that I ſtay, I am in great fault with yonder Knight. So he tooke his leaue, departing ſwifter then any thought, that way which the courteous Gyant directed him. Somewhat abaſhed, reſted the Ladye at her chaunce with the <hi>Dacian,</hi> but knowing who he was, it did not greene her. I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat your Ladyſhip, to follow mee ſoftly (ſaide the coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Gyant.) For doubtleſſe, ſome of thoſe Knightes may haue ſome neede, and in ayding them, will <hi>Roſicler</hi> be pleaſed.</p>
               <p>And turning the raynes of his <hi>Alfana,</hi> he tooke <hi>Don Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> way, and as he beſtryded the worldes beſt horſe, hee could neither ſee nor ouertake him, and with feare to looſe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:66"/>
the Lady, went but leaſurely: Yet <hi>Don Eleno</hi> iudged ſtowe the ſwiftneſſe of his <hi>Tirio.</hi> For hauing croſt moſt parte of the Forreſt, when the Sunne would ende his courſe, hard by the Sea ſyde he ſpyed one of the braueſt battels that he euer ſawe. It was one ſole Knight among many, and ſome Gyants, with leſſe furie followeth a towring Hawke on his praying game, then did the <hi>Dacian</hi> deſcend thoſe Mountaines, till he arriued hard by them, where he ſawe a damozell bound, that greatly exclaimed on her outrage, ſo he perceiued that about her libertie the battell was. He remembred not to haue ſeene a brauer Knight then he that fought: for they were ſome twentie Knights and thrée Gyants, and ſixe of them he had layde at his feete with one Gyant, ſo brauely he behaued himſelfe among them, that the <hi>Dacian</hi> thought him to be the Emperour <hi>Alphebo</hi> of <hi>Trebiſound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No longer ſtayed the couragious Louer, but giuing a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low to his horſe (a ſigne that he ſhould not leaue the battell, till the ende) he ſtrongly ſettled himſelfe in his ſtyrrops, and with <hi>Mars</hi> his ſtrength he threwe his Launce, it could not light but hitting one of the Gyants, that it pearſt him ſyde through ſyde. He caſt his ſhielde at his backe, and with <hi>Brutus</hi> famous ſworde, he began ſuch hauocke among them, that ere they could perceiue their daunger, fiue he had ſlaine. The ſonne of angry <hi>Garrofilla</hi> (for that was he) greatly eſteemed the <hi>Dacian,</hi> ſeeing his valour to be ſo great, that none durſt withſtand him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he would rid himſelfe of that vylde peeple, before he aſſaulted the Gyants: he did ſo, when two Knightes of haughtie diſpoſition arryued, the one knewe <hi>Polliphebo,</hi> as one that in her ſoule had him imprinted, being the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Floraliza,</hi> who without further ſtaye with her ſworde in both handes arryued almoſt as ſoone as <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was there ſeene more fiercer blowes, for both with the vtmoſt of their ſtrength, not regarding that the other did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, they diſcharged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al vpon him, deuiding him in thrée.
<pb facs="tcp:13977:67"/>
for euery one had his quarter. Enuious of the ſame, the <hi>Tinaerian</hi> caſting his ſheeld away brauely firming his feet in his ſtirropes raiſed his ſelfe on them, and with his ſword in both hands with incredible ſtrength he diſcharged his blow on the others left ſhoulder that to his ſaddle he cleaft him, and as if he had nothing done, he went to the Knights with theſe wordes. Had I bene aſſured of ſo good helpes Sir Knights, with more hope had I performed my combat. Small neede had you of our ayd (braue Knights) ſaid the amorous dame, and if we came it was only to know you and the cauſe of your battel. That was ſoly to right this Damſell (anſwered <hi>Trebarios</hi> ſonne) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> came in my demaund for certain buſineſſe, and ſo was ſhe taken by theſe gyants, that lyke vyllanes doe nothing elſe but robbe in the high wayes, whoſe fame now your vallour hath liberated. Touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt, ther is no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhould diſobey you, I am called the Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golden Branch, and no other thing do I know of my ſtocke.

To content her, <hi>Don Celindo</hi> hauing ſome feeling of his ſiſters affection did ſo, as much did the <hi>Tinacrian.</hi> But the <hi>Dacian</hi> rather deſiring to ſeeke his <hi>Roſamond,</hi> excuſed him ſelfe the beſt that he could, alleadging the neceſſity he had to part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ere he went, he tooke the vallorous <hi>Tinacrian</hi> aſide and thus ſaid.</p>
               <p>I am ſure (Soueraigne Prince) that you know me not, but many daies a goe haue I had perfect knowledge of your hauty deedes, and ſince our kindred bindes me to tell you whom I am, knowe that my name is <hi>Don Eleno</hi> of <hi>Dacia</hi> your louing coſen, he that for the liberty of your natiue ſoile imploied the vtmoſt of his power. Immeaſurable ioye receaued the Prince to knowe him, and rendring him many thancks for it, replied. In faith none with more reaſon ought to liue contented but I, ſeing my happie ſtarrs ſo highly bleſt me as to create me kinſman vnto ſo mighty

Princes, though great is my bonde to procure by deſert in ſomething to reſemble them, and for this would not be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen of the Emperor, vntill my déeds might make me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be eſtemed his Sonne. Thoſe are already ſo well knowen, (moſt valiant Prince) replyed the <hi>Dacian,</hi> that you maye deſeruedly bee called the Sonne of ſuch a Father: and becauſe it behooues me preſently to depart, I muſt commit you to God, in me while life indures ſhal you be aſſured of a perpetuall friend, his companye deſired the <hi>Tynacrian,</hi> but thinking it diſcourteſie ſo to leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knights that taryed for him, woulde not admit it, but taking his leaue of all he entred through the thickeſt of the Forreſt, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them in loue with his valour and gentlenes, diſmount did the <hi>Tynacrian,</hi> and lifting vp his Beuer, he went to the Lady that trembling expected him, to whome ſhe ſayde, I thinke ſir Knight of the branch, that yonder Knight in the Ruſſet did knowe you conſidering how hee vſed you and I wonder not, for ſome I knowe that only by hearing of your valour, beare you no ſmall good-will, hauing left their farr remoted countries, ſoly to enioy your ſight.</p>
               <p>Thats the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of true magnanimety (valiant knight) replyed he that becomming affectionate, in nothing doe they better ſhew the noblenes wherewith the Heauens haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched them, then in honoring thoſe in reputation inferior, and in credit. And therefore doe not I maruell, that more to ingreten your fame, then for any my deſerts, you haue vndertaken ſo great a toyle: wherefore if gratefulnes there maye bee any for ſo great and vnderſerued fauour, or if the imployment of my perſon in your ſeruice be part of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny payment I will doe it, euen with my verye ſoule, for of much more doe I iudge your worthines worthy of. No leſſe was hoped of you (ſir Knight of the branch) aunſwered the Ladye, and you liue not deceaued in what is deſired you. This opportunitie looked <hi>Don Cellindo</hi> for, to leaue his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter alone, who gaue him a Thouſand bleſſings for it, for taking occaſion to ſtall their Horſes, went away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:68"/>
with ſuch content of <hi>Floraliza</hi> to ſee her ſelfe ſo nere him ſhe loued that ſhe could not ſpeake. The gallant <hi>Tynacrian</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither toke of his helme, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knights conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed him, but with ſuch quicknes ſhe put of hers, that when he regazed on her the ſeemed to diſgrace <hi>Venus</hi> in her pride, a blow was it for the <hi>Tynacrian</hi> which he ſo ſone for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not, for firſt it coſt him much blood: he was amazed and I maruell not, for with more experience the like had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>Apollo</hi> that did to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnwarie youth. Well did the Lady note it, and was not ſorrie for it, but the ioyfulleſt in the world, ſeing that occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid, what haue you felt (ſir knight) for as I thinke by your exterior ſignes you ſhould not iudge amiſſe of the ſight of Ladies. Nay rather (replyed the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded youth) ſo great is the ioy it giues me, that the good was part to interrupt my ſences as the thing that excéeded their dull conceipts. More doth that aſtoniſh me (ſir Knight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Branch) replyed the Lady that you ſhould make me belieue ſo difficult a thing, yet I would credit it (liued I not vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued) that the grieuous ſhewes of gallants, many times prooues but conceipts, by which they would obtaine their Ladies fauours, onely due to thoſe that truely loue. Such as the former (valyant Lady replied he) do not with reaſon ponder, how great good it is to liue alienated, and for that cauſe fayning their loſſe, demaunde a coſtly remedie. And for them woulde I haue no other puniſhment then what a diſtruſt doth cauſe them, ſeing what fauors the true louers doe inioy. Nay then (ſir Knight ſayd the Lady) the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that you ſeeme to haue makes you condemne what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take for good. A little is for that needefull (ſayde the ſonne of <hi>Garrofilea</hi>) hauing at hand the reaſon that ſhal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it. Neuertheleſſe (ſir Knight anſwered ſhe) you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade me, but the thought of your good imployme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t makes you haue that opinion.</p>
               <p>Neuer (ſayd he) would fortune make me happie with ſo rich a fauour moſt ſoueraigne Ladie, as to let mee taſte of ſome good that by louing is obtained, and ſo thinke I long
<pb facs="tcp:13977:68"/>
for the hower to imploy my ſelfe, that I may iudge thereof. I ſay (replyed ſhe) I would not haue for my galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a knight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely procureth his owne pleaſure. As that muſt proceede from the Ladies hands (anſwered he) firſt ſhould I meaſure my affection by her will, and according to that proceede to her content, and not mine. Your purpoſes be not ſo ill (ſaid <hi>Floraliza</hi>) but that if your deedes were correſpondent to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you might finde her that would loue you. The Lady could ſpeake no plainer nor he ſee euidenter tokens to be beloued, but her beautie was ſo excellent that he thought all paſt but as chat to driue away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time. Neuertheleſſe he would once trie the fortune of his deſire, ſaying.</p>
               <p>In theſe matters of loue (moſt excellent Lady) I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard that Ladies are alwaies ſharpe and coye towards their gallants, and ſo this feare hath ſometimes driuen me from my bouldnes. It is reaſon (ſir Knight ſayd ſhe) that Ladies ſhould be rather loued and wooed, then gallants by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſued too: for ſo they ſhould diſparage their fame, (though not with deſire) they ſhew oftentimes ſome diſfauour: but for that cauſe muſt the louer be diſcréete, (which is what in him is firſt required) that he may note the one, and take the other in good part, attributing it to her feare, and not to her deſire, and this conſideration ſwéeteneſſe what is moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
               <p>Thus ſpunne they the webbe of their amorous liues whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Damſell here cut off their diſcourſe, ſaying with ſome anger, You (Knight of the branch) ſeeme to haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your promiſe, and ſeing the night approcheth there is no more to doe but ſtraight with me you enter in your Barke: without any companie it behooues vs to goe. Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (ſwéete damſell ſayde <hi>Polliphebo</hi>) that wee ſhoulde ſo manye dayes together Nauigate by Sea, thought you woulde let mee enioy, ſome on land, but ſeeing it muſt bee ſo, letts away though great is the wronge you doo mee. Greater is that which is ſuffered by whom néedeth
<pb facs="tcp:13977:69"/>
and ſent me for your perſon, hauing power to requeſt others that with more willingneſſe would haue done it, for though our ſtay here hath been but little, not ſo ſmall is the ſtayne that thereby your fame receaueth, and my neceſſitie increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, with a ſorrowfull looke the Prince turned to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaying. You ſee (deare Lady) my vnhappie chance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling mee from inioying your ſwéete conuerſation, for which all my life I ſhall lead in griefe, hauing not ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of hope to reſee you againe, for till the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anguiſh I ſhall ſuffer wilbe ſo great, as to debarre me from alpleaſure, for I onely haue, and ſhall haue in being yours. Valiant Knight (replyed ſhe,) no leſſe doe I féele it ſeing you thus to depart from me and my brother (which is yonder Knight) and as for the reſt you may liue aſſured, I tender you as my owne ſoule. And if this picture may be any cauſe of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t take it, for I will haue your cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeite for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. The gladdeſt on the earth he tooke it, and falling on his knées a Thouſand times kiſſing her handes, hee intreated her to take him for her Knight. The Ladye denied it not, for loue had made her liberall, and none did it euer touch, but made him become an <hi>Alexander,</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine of not knowing how to loue, ſeing that one of the chiefeſt condition that yf requires is (Magnanimetie.) And ſo ſeing with how great the Ladie had fauoured him, he againe kiſt her handes and taking his leaue of them knowing who they were they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Barke, which ſwifter then a towring. Eagle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulffed it ſelfe in the ſwelling <hi>Ocean.</hi> Straight did they looſe his ſight leauing <hi>Floraliza</hi> greatly diſcontented, the which her brother nothing demaunded the cauſe, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſhe ended with a ſigh ſaying.</p>
               <p>I greatly feare deare brother that this Knight will put me in mortall dangers, for I iudge his libertie to be great: and being Sonne and Brother to our deadly foes, it will be difficult for him to conſider if any pyne for him. Let not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grieue you (good Siſter replyed <hi>Don Cellindo</hi>) for if he loues he will eaſily doe it, how much the more in my iudgement
<pb facs="tcp:13977:69"/>
he departed captiue enough. So thought I (anſwered ſhe) but here is my vnhappineſſe, that trauelling through ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge countries, he may ſee ſome one fayrer, and being toucht w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this infirmitie, he will be apt to decline and ſo muſt be faine to wander in his ſearch. Let the feaſts firſt paſſe (ſayd <hi>Don Cellindo</hi>) and ſo I hope will this humor chang into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent. Thus determined they ſtayed till the next mornings Suns vpriſing, who knowing that <hi>Roſamond</hi> &amp; the <hi>Dacian</hi> ſhould méete, haſtened his ſhining preſence to ſee what happened in the next, related.</p>

Sir knight my Lady hath tane my oath, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> méeting in <hi>Grecia</hi> with anye Knight that ſhoulde denie her beautie to be the greateſt in the vniuerſe, I ſhould defie him to the battle, but this prouided that you bee in loue, though your deuiſe ſheweth the contrarie, and therefore to mortall fight I challenge you, for with leſſe then with your honour or life, I cannot ſatiſfie the duetie that I owe vnto my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Nay be it preſently (ſayd <hi>Eleno</hi>) inſolent Knight, for if my fortune had not been ſo aduerſe, fewe daies ſince, I had a Ladie in my companie, that <hi>Apollos</hi> light had darkened, for whoſe ſake againſt the mightie God of warre, I would haue maintayned what thou haſt vttered, being ſo great an vntroth: But here is <hi>Don Eleno</hi> that being hers is ſuffiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to chaſtiſe thy follie. And without further ſpéech w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch grace he turned his horſe, that a Thouſand ſoules if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhe had, ſhe would haue giuen him. And turning hers in a trice, ſhe tooke of her helme, glorifyng her armour with fine treſſes of Gould, chaines wherein <hi>Apollo</hi> would giue his deitie to be fettered in.</p>
               <p>In that manner ſhe ſtayde for him, hauing in like ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vanquiſhed him ſo.

Greatly ſhee reſted content that her Lord had ſpoken to the Emperour &amp; other Princes, but that which moſt ioyed her was the newes of the <hi>Tynacrian,</hi> whom ſhe greatly deſired to know, through the fame that in <hi>Callidonia</hi> ſhe heard of him. In conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſt they till the hower of three, that they tooke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next way to the Cittie, for they heard that three dayes after the Iuſtes would begin, ioying to ſee what multitudes thither reſorted, hoping for the day that they might approue before that ſinode of Maieſtie the valour of their armes. In this and in other pleaſing chat, (but moſt of loue for they were his ſlaues) continued the louers, and the ioyfulleſt that euer <hi>Cupid</hi> knew, when the ſame way they had taken, they ſaw towards them come two Knights of the beſt conſtitution, &amp; in as rich armour as either of them had ſeen, accompanyed with onely two Pages. They quickly met, and as among ſuch their chiefeſt ornament is courteſie, the biggeſt of them ſayde.</p>
               <p>Braue Knights can you tell vs any thing of the triumphs in <hi>Conſtantinople?</hi> We (ſir Knight replyed the <hi>Dacian</hi>) haue not been there, but haue heard, they are begun with greate ſolemnitie, and it was yeſterday told me the Emperour had commaunded them to ceaſe for eight dayes: and this is all

we know whilſt he replied he attentiuely gazed on his companion that ſpake to him, that he eſpied his ſword and looking well on it, he knew it hauing many yeares before bene his, and ſeeing it in a ſtrangers hands, he ſtraight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred he had loſt it in <hi>Rome</hi> that night that he deliuered the Princeſſes from the Gyants, as is in the former part recited, ſo expecting no anſwer again ſaid. And you Knight who gaue you that ſword, which coſt me no little blood in winning it? and therefore muſt you either giue it me or prepare to defend, for I will not part without it though it coſt me my life: Scarſe had he ſaid ſo when the eſquiers knew him, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two Knights were the one <hi>Liſarte</hi> King of <hi>Tarſis,</hi> and the other his ſonne <hi>Floriſarte</hi> Prince of <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria,</hi> and the pages thoſe that afore haue bene named to be the Princeſſe <hi>Roſelea</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Arbolinda</hi> Infant of Scotland.</p>
               <p>The Louer was ſo much aſtoniſhed as the Ladies to ſee him, for the other ſaid, I do not denie but it may be yours Knight, but the partie that me it gaue would with reaſon greatly be offended, if I ſhould ſo eaſily let it goe, not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt that the parting from it is by force and not for that it was ſo willingly giuen me, which animates me rather to dye then looſe it. Why then (replied the <hi>Dacian</hi>) defend thy ſelfe for by no meanes muſt I leaue it.</p>
               <p>The Louer anſwered not, but tourned his horſe with ſuch gallantneſſe, that <hi>Roſamond</hi> did greatly admire him, The like did the valiant <hi>Dacian</hi> &amp; with the lightneſſe of his horſe he incountred the <hi>Argentarian</hi> ſo mightily, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any maner of motion he made him looſe his ſtirrops, getting hould by his horſe maine for feare of falling while <hi>Eleno</hi> paſt like the wind.

ouerthrowen him, and with the furie of his <hi>Tyrio</hi> he ranne to the <hi>Tharſian,</hi> and as he paſt, with a flouriſh he gaue him a blow that on his horſe necke he threw him. He returned vpon him &amp; becauſe he could not ſtrike him with his ſword he incountred him with his horſe breſtes ſo mightily, that both him and his horſe he tumbled to the grounde, and leaping after him with more ligeritie then a nimble Hare, ere he could prepare himſelfe, he cloſed with him, and as his ſtrength was greater, he raiſed him aloft, but holding him ſo ſtrongly for feare of falling with him, he was fayne to ſett him downe, and with a thruſt made him ſtaggering giue backe three paces, and ere he could open his eyes, was againe vpon him. There had he wounded him, if his ſonne had not come, and ſydewayes gaue him ſo mightie a blowe, that maugre all his ſtrength, he went foure paces backe. Follow him would the haughtie Prince of <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> when the Ladye ſet her ſelfe before him, with more wrath then a troden Serpent, and with both handes laide on the youthes ſhield, which like to a piece of Wood ſhee cleft cleane in two, and myraculouſly he ſcaped his hande, which remained with ſuch paine that he could not ſtirre it. Both the one and the other, Father and Sonne, incurred mightie daunger, hauing ſuch ſtrong enemies. The gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant of <hi>Argentaria,</hi> returned her his aunſwere with ſuch ſtrength, that he made her ſee more ſtarres then in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were.</p>
               <p>But who bewayled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blowes in their ſoules with ſighes and pearled teares, were the two wofull Ladies, ſeeing their louers in ſuch daunger.

But her ſorrow helped not, nor her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

with ſuch intiernes auailed to aſſwage her paſſions. They could not deuiſe no meanes to make the battle ceaſe, for as they were fleſht in it, they thought it impoſſible, that any thing leſſe then the death of ſome ſhould part them, for at this time it ſemed that with more fiercenes it increaſed. The <hi>Tharſians</hi> dexteritie was it that defended him agaynſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angry <hi>Dacian,</hi> &amp; yet was it not ſo much, but being reached euery time he ſet both hands and knees on the earth, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not much better, for his aduerſarie neuer gaue him blow but bruſed and tormented his body, ſo that if he gaue he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued. In no leſſe danger was <hi>Roſamond,</hi> for onely her armour was it that in this battle ſaued her life. Euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sunne would ſet widdowing the earth of his light, there arriued the valiant <hi>Mauritanian Brufaldoro,</hi> that following the ſearch of the <hi>Tynacrian,</hi> and not finding, he came thither iudging y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for feare he had hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe.

               <p>Can you tell me pretie Pages the cauſe of this battaile, which ſhould not be little conſidering the fierceneſſe thereof. It is ſo ſmall ſir Knight (replyed <hi>Artimio</hi>) that it is gret pitie it ſhould be continued to the end for ſo ſlight a thing, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe being only that this Knight (pointing to <hi>Floriſarte</hi>) weareth aſword which he in the Ruſſet challengeth for his, ſaying he would not part without it, vnleſſe it coſt him his life. No longer ſtayed the mightie youth, but drawing foorth his ſword put himſelfe betwene them that were on foote ſaying. Heare me (ſir Knights) that ſeing ye haue no other reaſon, then what theſe Squiers haue told me, it were to be reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

paſſion to procure to maintain their fame vntill death: well did the <hi>Dacian</hi> know him, iudging him of great vallor ſeing he ſuſtained himſelfe to his honour againſt his Coſen <hi>Polle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo</hi> and ſo replied. It is not ſo ſmall Sir Knight as you thinke it for that knights ſword is mine, and I requeſted it with much courteſie, which was enough for him to giue it me he not only denyed it but allſo threatned me till death if I more demaunded it, which you ſee is ſufficient for a-thouſand battles: and I knew that in no cauſe you would haue left it. That were (anſwered the beautious <hi>Arbolinda</hi> with many teares) had not you giuen it willingly vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and with it leaue to be giuen to any, hauing no action to require it, and if like a Knight you gaue it, you ſhould no more haue rememberd it. The <hi>Dacian</hi> thought he ſhould know that voice to be of the Princeſſe of Scotland and ſo with ſome a maze anſwered: how know you good page that I did giue this ſword. I was brougt vp in <hi>Rome</hi> (replied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſguiſed <hi>Artimio</hi> ſure enough to be vnknowen) where I ſaw that in recompence of an inpriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by the gentleſt Gaoler in the world you gaue it. All this while the moſt beautious <hi>Roſelea</hi> did nothing but weepe currents of ſault teares, vnable to ſpeake on word: yet thus replied <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> So many requires a peace valiant Sir that he ſhould not deſerue to inioy any that would deny it, and ſo for this time I remit the battle ſo pleaſeth theſe Knightes. They will (ſaie the woefull diſtreſſed <hi>Roman</hi>) were it but to be more pittifull then you, that forgetfull of your owne honour and what you are bound to do, wander vp and downe, challanging battles of whom you know not, and without any reaſon.</p>
               <p>More a mazed then at firſt with theſe things remained the <hi>Datian</hi> for by their voices he thought he knew them both, and thinking long till he ſpake with them ſaid to <hi>Roſamond</hi> in her language, that it behooueth him to leaue that battle.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:73"/>She that was borne to loue him woulde not therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content him. And ſo ſtepping apart left the battle, leauing the Princes ſo bruſed that they could ſcarce ſtand. The king of <hi>Mauritania</hi> ſeeing the matter ended, demaunded for the Knight of the Branch, of whome <hi>Don Eleno</hi> gaue him the newes he knew, not knowing he was ſhipt to Sea after he departed from him.

who tooke it, not to be moued to Loue for therein he had not where with all being poſſeſt by <hi>Roſamond</hi> (notwithſtanding he replyed). In faith (good ſquiers) it greatly greeues me for the ſorrow the Princeſſe doth ſuſtain and of your trouble in ſeeking me: Although all might haue been remedyed, conſidering with what vyolence I was drawen away to leaue <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo much againſt my wil, ſeeing therein I offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoſe Ladies, yet I could do no otherwiſe, and ſo haue I not herein any cauſe to ſatisfie them in any thing. In the reſt, that my Lady the Princeſſe hath done me fauors, there is no ſatiſfaction may come neere, nor ſo much as be thought a little parcell vpon accoumpt, in parte for ſo many, and manifould benefits, which ſhe of her meere bounty &amp; magnanimity exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on me, inriching with them a poore forlorne Knight exiled from all content. And ſo ſince at this time there is no leaſure to write, and we all intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople,</hi> there wil I giue you my anſwere.

               <p>Hereupon they tooke their leaues not without many teares of both the Ladies, and he finding the Knights with <hi>Roſamond</hi> leauing them, retorned to their intended Iourny, till very nere the cittie the night ouertooke them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſummer they reſolued to paſſe it in that wood, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trees and Odoriferous flowers, vpon which they tooke their way.

               <p>They approched with deſire to knowe what might bee within a Pallace ſo pontificall: but for all they compaſſed it, they could finde no entrance thereto, more then tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a lane of Bryers and Thornes they diſcryed a moſt ſtately gate.

No leſſe horror made the gates in opening, none iſſued foorth: but within the Prince ſawe foure Arches in a rowe, in eyther of them his keeper: For in the firſt there was a moſt vgly deformed Gyant, with a mighty heauie mace on his ſhoulder, who at each ſide brought twoo moſt fierce beaſts ſhaped like Gryf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens. A ſudaine feare this vnequall fight cauſed the prince: but rememdring whoſe ſonne he was, his courage increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thinking that if he ouercame the kéepers of that Caſtle, he might iuſtly diſcouer himſelfe vnto his Father &amp; friends, and in this deſire he moued againſt them recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his protection vnto the God of the Gréekes. Scarſe had he done it when the Gyant with furious paces came towardes him letting looſe the beaſts that bellowing flung at the valyant youth, hee let them come, yet they approched (according to their ſwiftnes more then he would. The one ſnatcht away his ſhield breaking the handles, which not a little auailed the youth. The other tooke hould of his left ſide with teeth and nayles, he could not penetrate it, becauſe for more then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his armor had beene made at <hi>Venus</hi> ſuite, but they ſo much cruſht them, that he could not ſtirre.</p>
               <p>Already arriued the Gyant, hee was affrayde of death, for he ioyned with him with his mace aloft, and diſcharging his blowe, the Prince had no other remedie to ſcape it, but
<pb facs="tcp:13977:77"/>
to cloſe vnder vnder the Griffen, that held him, hee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his blowe, but vpon a piller of ſtones, the which it all broke. The other beaſt was not idle for not able to breake the ſhield, left it leaping vpon the Knight, houlding bim by the other ſide. Neuer ſtoode a Hart more ſtiffe helde by the force of houndes, then they made this new <hi>Mars</hi> ſtand. For theſe hungry Griffyns (not ſuffering him to bee Maiſter of himſelfe) tumbled him as they liſt, which made him ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient that he raued like a mad man ſeeing the danger hee was in: till the ſwéete remembrance of <hi>Liriana,</hi> adding cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to his ſtrength, made him ſcape from them, &amp; ſtepping aſide he expected them with his ſword twixt both his hands. They returned ſo hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerly vnto their pray but with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blowe he parted the one in two, dead, falling to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: yet was it impoſſible for him to defend himſelfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious gya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who ſeing his beaſt dead, let flie at his head, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenturouſly did the Britanicke youth a little ſtept aſide, ſo that it fully did not hit him, only it fell vppon the ſhoulder leauing all that part without armour, making him ſet that knée on the ground. Againe would the other fearefull beaſt cloſe with him, &amp; was ſo nere that he could not riſe, nor do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more then ſet the point of his ſword againſt him, vppon which the Gryffen ran vp to the middeſt, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pangs of death would help himſelfe with his winges. So ſomwhat parting from <hi>Oliuias</hi> ofſpring, deſcending ſtrucke him with his winges and bill that he almoſt wearied him, labouring alſo to defend himſelfe from the cruell gyant, that ſtriued to giue him one blowe at his pleaſure, with which he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt to end the battle with the Princes life, which at this time was admirable to ſee with what dexterity he defended himſelfe againſt the gyant, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what audacitie he expected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rauenous beaſt, al beſmeared w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blood y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own belly yſſued no more deſcending with his accuſtomed impetouſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for his want of blood had greatly weakened him, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did the amorous warrior perceaue it, ſo warding the blow from the Gyant, on the one ſide firmly ſett on his feete
<pb facs="tcp:13977:77"/>
expected the comming of the beaſte, which with horrible bellowing deſcended. It approched, and ſeing he could not ſhunne his blowe with the vtmoſt of his power he thruſt at him ſo mightily vnder the wing that it pared it all away, falling to the earth where it ſcant lighted when he ſeconded another, that almoſt in two peeces deuided, he fell vpon the paued floore. At what time the Gyant came, foming through his Beuer like a chafed boare, and rayſing his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible mace would execute his blowe, with his lightneſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> louer ſhunned it, arriuing with a happie ſtroake, for it cut his mace and his left hande, whoſe paine made the gyant roare like a Bull, whereat <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> that was without alſo feared, he gaue backe, yet not before the Prince hadd entred with a mortall thruſt pittifully wounding him on the breſt.</p>
               <p>By this had he drawne a ſtrong axe wherewith he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched againſt the Gréeke <hi>Hercules,</hi> giuing ſo manye, and ſo mightie blowes that he néeded all his ſkill to frée him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from them, and at length one reached him with ſuch puiſſance that falling on his rich helme, it made him ſet hands and knées on the grounde, hee followed with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which made him thinke he was in Heauen, ſo neare him he ſaw the ſtarrie Firmament, he loſte much blood tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his Beuer which was the cauſe altogether to inrage him. And ere hee gaue him another, hee roſe laying on his legge as he paſt ſo braue a blow that it cut it cleane off.</p>
               <p>This was the blowe that gaue him the victorie, for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, as he wanted his legge, he ſtumbled with his head at the Princes féet, who receaued him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a blowe with both handes on his helme, whoſe two fingers thicknes was cut, wounding him on the head that the blood iſſued in gret aboundance, though with trouble, yet hee rayſed himſelfe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vpon one foot, which litle auailed him, for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the exceſſe of blod he had loſt by his 4 wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, which had broght him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paſſe that he could no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on foot. This noted
<pb facs="tcp:13977:78"/>
the Britannicke Lord, and warding his laſt blow, he cloſed with him giuing another which hée felt no leſſe then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. No other remedie had the diuiliſh Gyant but to caſt his armes about him, cruſhing him ſo ſtrongly that he ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loſt his breath. To end this warre, <hi>Roſabell</hi> drewe foorth <hi>Hectors</hi> dagger, and twice ſtabbing it within his infernall bodie, at the laſt he drew it foorth with the Gyants life and ſoule, remayning ſo weary that he could not ſtirre, but ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he wanted to doe, he ſtayed for <hi>Oriſtoldo,</hi> to buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle on his Gauntlet, which in the beginning hee had loſt, who did it with exceeding ioy to ſée what he had done. Hée ſtraight tooke his leaue of him, and taking his ſhéeld mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched towards the ſecond Arch, where was a bigge propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Knight, armed all in azuce armour, with barres of gréene ammell, who came to <hi>Roſabell,</hi> and ſaying neuer a word, drew foorth a moſt rich ſword, the like did the <hi>Greeke</hi> and at once diſcharged the waight of eythers armes, that both field and Caſtle did reſound. The Knight of the Arche tooke him vpon his Helme, and made no impreſſion there, through the fineſſe thereof, yet it made him ſet handes and knées vpon the ground. He ſcapte not better, for the ſwoord being incomparable, reaching him on a ſide, it pared away halfe the helme, and with but a litle more ſtrength taking him full it hadd doone the like of his head, yet the furious blowe paſt forwards throwing downe a peece of his ſhield. Like an aſpen leafe the ſight of his enemies blowes made him tremble, ſeing that euery time he reached him both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and fleſh he cut, his lightnes &amp; not his inchantments here auayled him, for his aduerſaries ſword was of more antiquitie, and ſo hee was faine with nimblenes to defend himſelfe, entring and ſallying to <hi>Roſabels</hi> coſt. So ſidelong he gaue ſuch a blowe that he made him giue backe ſo much that hee almoſt fell, he was ſo quicke that with a counter-buffe he helped him to it and iuſtling him with his ſholders, he almoſt ouerthrewe him if he had not fallen on his hands. The occaſion would not the inchanted youth omit, for with
<pb facs="tcp:13977:78"/>
both hands he gaue him ſuch a blowe vppon his ſhoulders, that the paine made him roare a loude: but as hee ended ſo great was the inraged kindled wrath which in the Gréekes breſt burnt, that the hunted Lyon by the furious ounce was inferior to it, and méeting with his enemie he gaue him a mightie wound on his breaſt, which verie neare did cut the bone. This contented not the angry youth, for hee gaue him another vppon his helme, leauing him their piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded.</p>
               <p>The gallant louer conſidering how much hee had to doe haſtened the end of the battle, and therefore, they aſſaulted with their ſwordes croſſe, and with a ſpéedie traueſſe the Gréeke voyded his aduerſaries ſtroake, and like an Eagle on the left-ſide he entred with a downe right blowe that his thigh was cut away. It cauſed the inchanted Knight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable griefe, but it was no time for pitie, with a poynt he pierſt his arme, and followed it with ſuch deſire that hee of the Caſtle procured to cut away his cuſhes. It was no ill deuiſe for giuing him a mighty blowe on the legges, he ſo tormented them that had he at that inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cloſed, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the victorie, but he ſtaid himſelfe with another that at his waſte he let flie, which wounded him though but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Till then was neuer ſéene a more crueller battaile, for the <hi>Greeke</hi> is almoſt tired, and with many blowes that bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his fleſh, and thought his enemie farre more nimbler the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at firſt, though beſmeared with his owne blood, that from his woundes yſſued. It was an admirable thing to ſee the horror that their ſwordes made, which excéeded the gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anticke noiſe in <hi>Vulcans</hi> worke-houſe, when thoſe armes were forged which the Gréeke woare, who putting his truſt in them, letting fall his ſhield with both hands hee went to his enemie (that being alreadie reſolued to die, killing or be kild) in like manner came againſt him, and together they diſcharged ſuch blowes, that the Greeke Prince fell down, voyding blood from his eyes, noſtrels, and mouth, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered himſelfe a while after, and loking for his enemie hee
<pb facs="tcp:13977:79"/>
founde him on the earth for though the blowe was not on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head, lighting on his ſhoulder it cut him down vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bone, caſting him dead vpon the ground. He reioyced to haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the victorie, though he remayned ſo bruſed, that hee was faine to ſit downe, and take of his helme to wipe away the blood of from his face. <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> and <hi>Allirio</hi> then came, for as he wonne the arches they paſt forwards which they could not doe till the end of euery battle. They demaunded how he felt himſelfe? weary (replyed hee) though glad, to haue ended ſo dangerous a battle as with the Knight in the azure armor, he would no longer abide but taking his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons went to the thirde arche, where walked a Knight no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inferior to the former, armed all in yellow armor bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with azure. This thus ſayd. Knight I eſteeme &amp; honor thee as thy merits doe deſerue, for the haughty deedes thou haſt done, which none elſe in the vniuerſe could atchiue, I counſell thée to returne backe, making no battle with mee, for of it thou ſhalt get nothing but a cruell death. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to thee (anſwered the Greeke) for thy courteous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but in no caſe wil I leaue this battle, for it wil be my euerlaſting infamie, why then (ſayd the keeper) take this launce and horſe for ſo thou muſt make thy battle. This pleaſeth me beſt (replyed the Prince) and ſo toke the launce. Already was his enemie prepared, &amp; very neere to doe what the Greeke imagined not, for hee had ſcarce got into the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other ſpurring his horſe, (which had bin taught to that) ſo brauely he incountred the Prince, that hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a great fal, the not hauing gotten his ſtirrops ſaued the Greeke from being conquered, and ſo though bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed he roſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the launce in his hands which he had not loſt. But he was not well ſet on foot when behind him came another Knight, with an Iron mace and backwards gaue him ſuch a blowe vpon his helme, that it fild it within with blood, caſting him forwards againe vpon the ground.</p>
               <p>The Prince that ſet himſelfe ſo aſſaulted (feareful of deth) ſet himſelfe on foote auoyding a blow of him with the mace,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:79"/>
but he could not ſcape from hlm on horſe-backe, with <hi>Ioues</hi> ſtrength rayſing himſelfe on his ſtirrops flung his launce at the Prince which lighted on his ſhield, and reſounding like a bell it bounded backe as if it had ſtruck vpon a flint, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Greeke</hi> ſtagger twoo ſteps backwards. A hungry Tygre of <hi>Hyrcania</hi> rauening for his pray, was not more fierce then <hi>Roſabell</hi> nowe became, for brandiſhing his cruell launce, hee darted it to the knight lighting in the middle of his ſhield. It fetcht him from his ſaddle cleane ouer his horſe backe tumbling him to the earth. More ſoner vpon her game is not a ſwift wingd Fawlcon then now was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince, for ere the Knight could riſe to make himſelfe redy, or he with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mace come, he gaue him on the helme ſo cruell a blow that al the brym he cut with a peece of his front. The blood blinded him, &amp; ſo neither did he ſee, nor could helpe his companion that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his mace came after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Greeke, and before he parted from the wounded one, he thruſt at him with a point which ſhrewdly wounded him, the other came ſo much ſide-long vpon him that he could not but caſt his armes vpon him, he gayned litle, for the Britanicke louer being of geater forces then he, breathleſſe did caſt him to the ground. He ſtriued ſo long with him till hee drewe his dagger, with which hee ended his life, ſtriking it to his hart. It had like to had coſt him no leſſe then his life, for the other, though ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was come vpon him, and with his dagger would back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes haue ſtabde it in his breſt, wearing <hi>Hectors</hi> armor none but, <hi>Venus</hi> woundes coulde make any impreſſion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he felt exceſſiue paine euery time he ſtrucke him he was aſhamed of himſelfe, that one Knight ſhould alone ſo long, ſo handle him, &amp; well firming himſelfe, in ſpight of him he roſe vp, &amp; finding him within his reach, with one kinde of death hee equald them.

One the floore of the ſame yard beneath were ingrauen many Hiſtories, with all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous Knights moſt liuely figured. They ſawe the battle which the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Zoylo</hi> had made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the hawty <hi>Mauritanian Brufaldoro,</hi> and his dolefull departure from his deare <hi>Tigliaffa,</hi> who ſuppoſing he was dead, was by <hi>Luperſios</hi> order w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drawne within that pallace.

               <p>May it be (deare Ladie) that the power of a conſtant loue hath ſo rooted it ſelfe within your breſt, that not reſpecting my ſauageneſſe, my more then barbarous ſauadgneſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It neuer grieued me to be vnloued, but it onely tormented mee (as in reaſon it ſhould) that the firſt time ſo famous a Prince ſhould ſhrinke from his worde, it ſhould bee from me. This and nothing but this, hath made mee wander through the world, as it beſt can witnes, ſo greatlye to my fames coſt, and honours blemiſh: but ſince it hath pleaſed the heauens to pittie my paines, mollifying your flint ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate heart, in recompence to ſee my ſelfe beloued of my

deare <hi>Zoylo,</hi> I accompt my diſcontent my greateſt content, yf I any did paſſe: And now lets giue order for your wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds cure, for yet you are more bound then you are aware of, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part they would, vnto the next village, when through the Forreſt they ſpyed a damſell comming towards them, more ſwifter then the raging winde, and arriuing ſayde. Away braue ſirs, for the <hi>Tartars</hi> life hath been reſerued by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thereof onely for my comming. And ſo going to hym, ſhe drewe forth a glaſſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a moſt Odoriferous licour, whoſe fragrant ſmell comforted all the circumſtants the which ſhe ſet vnto his mouth. Oh deuine thing, for ſcarce ſhe had ſet it, and hee taſted what it contained, when hee remained whole of his wounds, though weake through the much blod he had loſt, his due thanks would hee render for that great good déede, but ſhe was vaniſhed vn-ſeene of any. To this famous Knight (ſayde <hi>Tigliaffa</hi>) muſt you giue them for tis he that his mightie arme hath fréede both you and me, from whence the world elſe had not béen able to do, deliuering vs from the cruell torment wee both iniuſtly ſuffered, for theſe wounds, for all they ſéemed ſo freſhly to bléede, you recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them aboue 6. yeares agoe, in preſence of the vnhappie <hi>Tigliaffa,</hi> that ſeing it receaued them no leſſe. Thereupon did the beloued Prince remember that about the armes of of <hi>Bramarante</hi> a Knight had giuen him them. He turned to the gallant <hi>Roſabell</hi> that excéedinly ioyed to ſée him well, &amp; caſting his armes about his necke, ſeing him ſo young ſaid. Oh moſt mighty Knight, is it poſſible that from your hands hath proceeded ſuch a benefit? there is no recompence can equall my receaued fauor, I will not binde my ſelfe for it, (though eternally I will acknowledge my debt) becauſe I feare that being of ſuch waight my ſhort life will not ſuffer me in part to ſhew my gratitude: but oh God what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comfort maye I now enioy then to beholde betwene my armes him that ſo much reſembles <hi>Roſicler</hi> the Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi> my greateſt friend: and if in any thing he touches you (ſir Knight) I intreate you by the thing you muſt loue
<pb facs="tcp:13977:83"/>
&amp; hope to enioy in this world you would not denie it me: for if you are Sonne vnto my Lady the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia,</hi> much did the king <hi>Sacridoro</hi> in her rape, yet coſt it mee no leſſe woundes, and had I loſt my life it had been pleaſing, ſo hee obtayned her his deſired pryze to his valour onely due. Excellent Prince (replyed <hi>Roſabell</hi>) your valour was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitient without your merits on the Gréeke Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe deſerued, to binde all the worlde to your ſeruice. In the reſt touching himſelfe, I knowe no more then that to this Prince of <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſonne vnto that King you na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and to mee there hath happened ſo manye thinges, (ſince my Fortune cauſed vs to meete, in me to knitte a league of inuiolable friendſhip) beſides what before befell mee, euen afore that Greeke Lord, that we dare preſume to ſaye, I am ſonne to thoſe ſo much behoulding vnto you, and with like deceipte was prince <hi>Roſicler</hi> by a ſtrange aduenture parted from me in <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> More then this I aſſure you I knowe not.</p>

Anewe they imbraced each other: for greater friendes the earth neuer knewe. Exceeding glad was the gallant Ladie to ſee her ſelfe in companie of ſuch hawghtie knights, but more to be beloued of him that once liued by hating her.</p>
               <p>So well did the two friendes handle this matter, that they altogether aſſured the Iealous Lady of her hopes procuring the <hi>Tartare</hi> to eſpowſe her ſeing her fayth dyd meryt more then that.

               <p>A brauer Knight was not ſeene in <hi>Greece,</hi> nor that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter managed his horſe, he entred the Liſts, and being excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding courteous, he firſt did his dutie to the Ladies, a thing that in euery one is highly to be comended. What thinkes your Maieſtie (ſaid the Prince <hi>Meridian</hi> to the Emperoure <hi>Trebatio</hi>) of the aduentures gallantnes, I doubt the Ladies Knight will incurre ſome diſgrace, for ſuch diſpoſition few obtaine. Of the like opinion was the Emperour &amp; the moſt of the Court, it was not much, for more deſerued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight who with admiring puiſſance ſpurred againſt <hi>Lindoriano,</hi> that doubting ſome miſchance had taken freſh horſe: but it preuailed not, for he in the Blacke encountring him in the middeſt of his ſhield, did cleerely pierce it, &amp; ſtaying in his breſt-plate, hee thruſt him ſo mightily that cleane ouer his horſe-backe he fetched him to the ground with the ſaddle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his legges, for yet in that would Fortune ſeeme to fauor him, that ſom partial fauorits he had might attribute his fall to his horſes fourniture, and not for want of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
<pb facs="tcp:13977:85"/>
which was ſo well knowne to the coſt of ſo many. His ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops loſt the diſtreſſed aduenturer, but he recouered them ſo ſoone that fewe noted it not, he returned with ſuch brauery that moſt were affected to him, except the Ladies, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremelie ſorrowed for their Knights diſgrace. It no leſſe grieued <hi>Roſicler,</hi> who fayning ſome indiſpoſition went to arme himſelfe, for he would not haue it ſayd, that in <hi>Greece</hi> the ſtrangers had got the beſt, and putting on his inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted armor he caſt ouer them a ruſſet coate, that he might not be knowne. And in this manner vpon a mighty horſe, hee went forth of the Citie determined to enter in the liſtes, in Ladies behalfe, aſtoniſhed at the Knights valour vnable to imagine who it ſhould be, bethinking himſelfe it might bee the <hi>Mauritanian Brufaldoro,</hi> hauing heard him highly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Hereupon he ſtayed to let the day be farther paſt, that the Knight might get more honor, who like a fleſhed Lion w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the anguiſh that for his Lady he ſuſtained, twas pitie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his lamentable blows, for eyther ſlaine, or ſorely wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded none eſcaped his hands.</p>
               <p>Well did the Mirrour of Chiualrie <hi>Claridiano</hi> ſee it, and had the like deſire that his Vncle: but he ſo deſpaired to ſee the ſtrangeneſſe wherewith his Ladie vſed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee would not arme himſelfe vnles he were commaunded. And to moue it, he ſtept to the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi> (for with her the Queene of <hi>Lyra <hi>Archiſilora</hi>
                  </hi> ſtill accompanied) and to her he ſaid, I belieue moſt excellent Princeſſe, that he in the black will ſo well he haue himſelfe, that he will force many to trie their fortune, although ſome are ſo without it that not going with ſome particuler fauour, they are like to meete with ſome greater miſfortune.</p>
               <p>Well did ſhe perceaue with what affection hee hadd eyed the Queene, and as ſhee was ſkilfull in that art, by the cauſe ſhee ſpyed the effect, and deſirous to ſpeake for him, ſhee ſayde. Greate reaſon haue you braue Prince to require ſo iuſt a thing, and if myne may in any
<pb facs="tcp:13977:86"/>
thing preuaile, from henceforth I giue it you though ſeeing what is betweene vs, it ſhould be attributed onely to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicler:</hi> But here is the Queene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> that will giue it, if it be by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding you, for otherwiſe againſt her is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrong co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, &amp; it is well ſhe may haue ſuch a defender. The haughtie dame hereby ſuſpected ſomewhat: and ſo gloryfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her beautie with a heauenly tincture ſhe replyed. Little can a Ladies graunted fauour auaile, for the valour of the Prince of the <hi>Greece</hi> moſt (excellent Lady) and rather there are ſome ſo happileſſe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding, that they put in doubt what the gallants with their fortitude haue aſſured. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe I accompt my ſelfe, and in ſo much that I know not when I could call my ſelfe happie. And this is the cauſe I dare not require any to goe forth in my name, but beeing dryuen to that neceſſitye, beeing able to doe it my ſelfe, I neede not intreate it of any. And becauſe ſhee would not be more importuned ſhee turned to him in the blacke, that more furious then a hungry Beare ran vpp and downe. It was no ſmall vertue in the Prince to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure with patience this bitter anſwere, a Thouſand cries would hee haue giuen publiſhing the iniuſtice done to hys faith, vſing it with ſuch cruelty, he departed from thence, for his ſighes gaue him not leaue not ſo much as to take leaue of the ſweete enemie of his tormented ſoule. Who with atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gazed on the amorous Knight, that at this time with his owne hand had choſen a ſtrong launce, for at a corner of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, there entred two Knights no leſſe to be wondred at then the former, at the ſame inſtant, entred two other no leſſe gallant then the firſt. Theſe laſt were armed in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey armour, with barrs of azure and gold, on their ſhieldes he that ſeemed bigger of body had a Sunne, in middle of a cleare heauen, with theſe wordes.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Theſe two Knights poſies greatly delighted euerye one, for if yee bee remembred they bee none other but <hi>Lyſarte</hi> the mighty King of <hi>Tarſis,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Floriſarte</hi> Prince of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentaria,</hi> that came acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two diſguiſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, they paſt the place with more grace then <hi>Achilles</hi> had done. The like did the twoo firſt, for both were armed in moſt rich armour, hee on the right hand that was <hi>Don Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gante</hi> of <hi>Fenicia,</hi> had a ſiluer armor, full of <hi>Lillies:</hi> on his ſhield a Pyne tree, and hee himſelfe leauing againſt it, with this poſie.</p>

                  <l>In ſollitude delights</l>
                  <l>He that on loue doth dote:</l>

               </q>
               <p>That Knight is not like to want battailes, that to ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach the Ladies worthes ſhewes himſelfe ſo free: for as euery one liueth by being alienated, they will preſently put it to triall. Now am I very glad (ſayd the beauteous <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daraza</hi>) that ſo free a Knight maye meete with him in the blacke, that is ſo conſtant in his alienation. No leſſe dyd his companion ſhew himſelfe vn-yoaked (being the gallant <hi>Toriſiano,</hi> who was all in Carnation armour, quartered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> golde and azure, a brauer temper was not ſeene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:87"/>Hauing approched they entred the Liſtes. None of the behoulders durſt take their eyes from them thinking in the meane time they ſhould looſe them ſo furiouſly they paſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The firſt that in <hi>Greece</hi> met with ill fortune was he of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> that quicker then an Eagle ſpurerd againſt him in black, he got little for the ſorrowfull louer incountred him with the vtmoſt of his ſtrength, (which only merited com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with the Greeke Princes) lightly fetching him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſaddle threw him to the ground, he receaued no ſmall encounter, for <hi>Don Argante</hi> was one of the ſtrongeſt in the world, he made him looſe his raynes, and forwardes paſſe more ſlowly then he would. Great was the noyſe that roſe in the place, as alſo among the Ladies, that celebrated the fall with accuſtomed diſdaine, which well maye bee called death: And thats but little conſidering howe tis taken, (I almoſt ſpeake by experience.) I maruell not at the Knights diſgraces (deare Ladies ſayd the old King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with your diſfauour. Your highnes ſpeaketh w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great reaſon (anſwered the Princeſſe <hi>Oliuia</hi>) to ſupplye which want, I intreated the Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi> that (to ſhewe howe ſhe loues me) ſhe would haue beſtowed one fauor vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant that from it he might haue drawen valour to aſſure our buſines that ſo goeth to wracke, hee replyed. There is no reaſon any thing ſhould be denyed to ſo iuſt a demaund, the which if my age did not diſturbe, I would haue béen he that ſhould haue craued it.</p>
               <p>A Thouſand ſhould your highnes haue obtayned (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Archiſilora.</hi>) But there wants not them that without any may returne the Grecian honor to their owners. Their that was broken off by the peoples rumor: for the mourning Knight, with more ſtrength the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Hector</hi> had, did ouerthrow the braue <hi>Toriſiano</hi> which diſpleaſed the Ladies. Many ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions paſt there who the blacke knight ſhoulde bee, for ſome Ladies were affected to him. And ſo with ſome pittie the Empreſſe <hi>Claridiana</hi> ſayde to them that were with her. Greatly doe I commiſſerate this Knight to ſée with what
<pb facs="tcp:13977:87"/>
crueltie his loue his repayd: And if his fauors were equall to his ſtrength none might more bragge of valour then hee. Thoſe that on a ſudden begyn to loue, (anſwered the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Roſiluera</hi> that in the ſecret of her ſoule, had portrayed the knight with ſuch coulors that none but death could wipe away) any little occaſion miniſters vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe of Loue: but lets ſée what ſhall become of the Knights of the <hi>Sunnes,</hi> that ſéeme of a valiant diſpoſition, his Carrier had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braue King <hi>Liſarte</hi> taken, incountring with the blacke knight, ſo fiercely that he thought he had béen broken in pieces, either paſt by the other without any moouing. Of the valianteſt was the <hi>Tarſian,</hi> but he there met with <hi>Bembo,</hi> then whom the <hi>Pagan</hi> nation neuer knewe more hawghtier, and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious knight: who taking another launce incountred hym ſo mightily, that hee brought him to the ground, &amp; himſelfe had almoſt accompanied him, for looſing brydle and ſtirrops was fayne to ſtay himſelfe by his horſe neck. Like to a fiery Dragon his amorous ſonne ran with him thrée launces, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to mooue eyther of them from the ſaddle, to both theyr extreme griefes, that like to bloodie Lyons, they with their owne handes chooſed their launces, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exceſſiueneſſe of their forces incountred ſo puiſſantly that the beleued <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentaria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> came to the ground with his horſe ſlaine betweene his leggs, he leapt from him for feare of ſome diſgrace. The <hi>Achayan</hi> with the ſtrong ſhocke ſtaggering backwards loſt his ſaddle, falling on his féete, but with ſo ſmall féeling, that though the couragious youth ſtept to him with his ſwoord, drawen, he ſo ſoone ſaw him not.</p>
               <p>Almoſt was the whole place in an vproare, for <hi>Floriſarte</hi> required a battle alleadging hee was not ouercome. So farre paſte this matter, that of neceſſitie it was carryed to bee decyded by the Emperour and other Kings there, who adiudged that the Knight of the Sunne, could not returne to the Iuſtes nor demaunde farther battle, becauſe hee had loſt his ſaddle, he held his peace ſéeing whoe hadde orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, and ſo on foote he ſtoode looking on the Iuſtes, talking
<pb facs="tcp:13977:88"/>
to the timerous Squires. Long ſtood he not ſo, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſent him a Courſer nothing inferior to that hee hadd loſt. Both Father and Sonne imputed it to Soueraigne magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>At what time matters paſt to <hi>Bembos</hi> immortal prayſe, together there entred the yarde two Knights, on whoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition all the lookers on fixed their wondring eyes. The one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt became his ſaddle, was in yellow armour full of halfe Moones ouercaſt with a Ruſſet coate, at his ſaddle pummell there hung a mightie mace of ſteele. On his ſhield (that of fine ſkill ſéemed) was a Ladye in liuely coulors fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, and hard by her a <hi>Phenix</hi> with this <hi>Motto.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>It is a quection hard,</l>

               </q>
               <p>The Knight ſeemed ſo braue a horſe-man and ſhewed ſo rare a conſtitution, that manye ſuſpected who hee was, no leſſe brauery adorned the ſecond, that on a ſtrong &amp; mightie Roane Courſer was mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, his warlike abillements were of a ſad red coulor with greene barrs, and golden grauings. On his ſhield was a beauteous Lady, lying along in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, and hard by her foure Gyants, among whom ſtoode he with his ſword all bloody, for about her libertie he had cut off their heads, and hauing done he ſemed to approch the Lady, that ſtretching forth one of her hands, ſeemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that ſeruice, alſo on the ſhield were theſe words.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Thryce happie is that death.</l>
                  <l>Which doth aſſure his hope:</l>

               </q>
               <p>For a iuſt guerdon iudged the Princeſſes, and ſhee that was figured meritorious of much prayſe for intertayning a knight, that in the beginning of his loues performed ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored

a fact. This Knight firſt arriued at the beginning of the liſtes, whoſe hawghtines well ſhews him to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <hi>Brufaldoro,</hi> that not finding the <hi>Tynacrian,</hi> hoping to meete him in thoſe Feaſtes changing his armor, came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the inſtant that the other Knight did the like, diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the habit of an <hi>Affrican.</hi> Who comming with ſo great deſire to Iuſt, without farther aduiſe would haue entred the liſtes, had it not been that the furious <hi>Mauritanian</hi> ſaid, you Knight, becauſe of your new attire will not onely commit a diſcourteſie, but thinke it ſhould be tollerated, keepe you out for others haue firſt arriued, and with more reaſon to Iuſt then you.

               <p>The furious <hi>Bembo</hi> woulde not looſe it, but rather ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Beuer vppon his fierie Courſer, leauing on his launce ſtoode to behold it. With more horror then a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Sea met the twoo moſt mighty warriours, in the
<pb facs="tcp:13977:89"/>
middle of their ſtrong ſhieldes, with their ſtrenghts cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly piercing them. The furie of each aduerſarie was ſtayed on their breſt-plate, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the ſhiuers of their broken lau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces mounted into the higheſt regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the aire, whoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude might haue bereaued <hi>Argos</hi> of his hundred eied ſight. Forwards they paſt without receauing any more tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting griefe then eyther did conceaue to ſée the other on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe. So with this rauening wrath which poſſeſſed both alike, they returned either vpon the other. On y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth there was not ſéene (then the Gréeke) a more ſkilfuller knight of the weapon that at his ſaddle hung.</p>
               <p>And ſo at once with the ſtrength of ſuch mightie armes they diſcharged ſo puiſſant blowes, that euerie one (conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their furie) thought them the laſt. All the toppe of his Burgonet loſt the Greeke, and voyding blood hee was caſt along his horſe back. Worſe ſped the <hi>Pagan</hi> for <hi>Roſicler</hi> reaching him fully with the heauie mace, had almoſt tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him from his horſe, notwithſtanding it ſo fell, that hee fell ſenceleſſe vpon his Courſers necke, ſhedding much blod through his noſe and eyes. Many with feare of thoſe feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtroakes wiſht themſelues farre off: but they that were borne to it quickly ioyned. It was well for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pagan</hi> to haue entred with his ſword for vnder his ſhield about his left ſide betwene the cloſing of a buckle he wonded him. It is not a fierce or da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous blow that can daunt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawghty Greeke: but to ſee his owne blood ſpilte, madded him, yet that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the <hi>Moore,</hi> but as he ſtept forth with a counter buffe he ſtrucke him on the helme. This blow dazled his ſight, and therefore he could not execute his to any purpoſe, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him on the outward ſide with the mace, the <hi>Moore</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned awaye (for fewe were nimbler then hee) making him not onely looſe the blowe, but hazarded the condicion of his victorie: becauſe the ſtrength thereof with the wayght of the Clubbe ſo diſturbed him, drawing hym after, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> might at his pleaſure giue him twoo thruſtes at one of his ſides. Eyther of them hadd pierced
<pb facs="tcp:13977:89"/>
him, if hee had not put on that precious armor, that with ſuch curioſitie of art the wiſe <hi>Artynidoro</hi> had forged. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe hee felt ſuch paine that hardly hee could drawe his breath, he returned altogether like an <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, and with his ſteele Mace he gaue him ſuche a blow (through anger of reuenge he ſomewhat miſt his ayme) that the <hi>Pagan</hi> thought himſelfe wrapt in fome clowde, ſo nigh he imagined to be to Heauen: ſéeing ſuch multitudes of Starres about his head, hee aroſe, and began ſo fierce a battaile, that the Princes which beheld them reſted ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>What thinke you braue Prince (ſaid the Emperour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo</hi> to <hi>Meridian</hi>) of the valour of theſe Knightes? for in my opinion I haue not ſeene the like: and hee of the deuiſe with the Gyants, greatly reſembleth a <hi>Pagan</hi> that I knighted, who after (about the armour of <hi>Bramarante</hi>) bereft of life our deare friend the <hi>Tartarian Zoylo:</hi> for by his ſudden aſſayling, and the liberall domination he hath ouer himſelfe in the battaile, I iudge him to be hee: he will neede all helpes (replied the <hi>Scythian Prince</hi>) for his aduerſarie differs not in ſhew from that youth we met in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> whome wée left with opinion to be your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin: and if it be he the victorie will be his, for the Prince <hi>Roſicler</hi> (as he himſelfe ſaid) was with twoo blowes by him feld.</p>
               <p>The noiſe that in the place did ſuddenly ariſe, broke off their talke, (for if any of them obtained any aduantage ſtraight ſome fauourite of his would celebrate the blow of his affected) as now, ſome the Greeke, and ſome the <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanian,</hi> would praiſe aboue the heauens.</p>
               <p>Somewhat a wearie were they, and ſéeing the ſunnes declining with the nights beginning to approch, with the vtmoſt of their forces they diſcharged their furie in ſuch ſort that they ſtruck each other fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their horſes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the beholders.

looſe out of his hands, firſt executing a braue blow, which wrunge his aduerſaries helme about his head, greatly blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſight: they had not fallen when quicker then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination they roſe. The Greeke drew foorth that good ſwoord, which <hi>Brandafidell</hi> did giue him, when he loſt his of Queene <hi>Iulias:</hi> and with it before the <hi>Pagan</hi> ſetled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he ſtrucke him about the toppe of his ſhield: he cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a peece therof with all the brimme of his helme on that ſide, he made him ſtand trembling like a leafe ſhaken by a Northren blaſt: he well noted his amaze, and ſo loſt not the occaſion, for with a loftie floriſh ouer-head hee made him there repaire his warde, leauing his legs without defence. Whereuppon the Prince ſtept more in with his left foote, and ſtanding ſtrongly thereon, withdrawing his ſwoord, with both handes executed his blow, on his left thigh cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to the bone. This wound was it that gaue him ſome aduantage ouer the <hi>Mauritanian,</hi> and alſo the victorie, if the battaile to the end continued: For the <hi>Pagan</hi> began to looſe much blood, and to ſhrincke through faintneſſe on that ſide euery time he was there charged. They parted to breath, for foure houres without reſt had they combated ſince they began. The Greeke as he walked caſt vp his eyes towards the windowes, where he ſpied his deare <hi>Oliuia:</hi> and with a ſighe breaking from the middeſt of his heart he began: I know not why thou ſhouldſt eſteeme thy ſelfe Prince of <hi>Grecia:</hi> to haue obtained thy Lady by force of armes? Thou art wronged and not in the leaſt degree ſo to be praiſed for it, hauing no reaſon for it ſeing that before al thy Parents, freinds and kinſfolkes, their preſence muſt beare witneſſe of all thy former honors wracke in this ſole battle. Where, in this particuler Combate with a ſingle knight thou looſeſt in one minute all the glorie in ſo many yeares with dere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and loſſe of thy deareſt blood, thou diddeſt atchiue. No leſſe exclaimes did the furious <hi>Pagan,</hi> breath into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aire, blaſpheming gainſt his Gods, ſaying. Why now none néed feare the name of <hi>Brufaldoro?</hi> nor is there any cauſe his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
<pb facs="tcp:13977:90"/>
ſhould eſtéeme him ſince before his greateſt enemies, ſo ill he doth defend her beautie: reaſon haſt thou to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine (deare Ladie) of thy Gallant, that in ſight of thy rare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, he hath not the power to beate his aduerſarie from the field, but ſee himſelfe to be brought vnto the point of a ſhamefull ouerthrow: he ended turning to his enemie that like a raging whirlewind, marcht againſt him. To meete him went the haughtie <hi>Pagan,</hi> being the firſt that executed ſuch a blow vpon the Greeke that he made him ſet one knee to the earth, diſcharge he would another: but <hi>Roſicler</hi> being more actiue, in that Art, before the <hi>Pagan</hi> ſtrucke, ſetling himſelfe on his right legge, he ſtept aſide, not making hym looſe his blowe, but ſtaggering ſeeme to fall, with a thruſt did the louer of <hi>Oliuia</hi> reach him, it pierſt his armor, and he felt it within his fleſh: like to the winde he roſe, &amp; with both hands, did ſtrike at him. Little preuailed the defence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrong ſhield, for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one end to the other it was cleane cut, and ſo ouer-charged him that both handes hee ſet on the ground. He thought to ſurprize him as hee fell, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within him more then he ſhould, inſomuch that he could not wound him: For the <hi>Pagan</hi> caſt his mightie armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, beginning with aduiſe, an admirable wraſtle. He rayſed him from the ground, and had almoſt caſt him down, if the Greeke, had not withall his power held him faſt, and in that occaſion with a trip got from him, &amp; ſtrongly ſwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him about, hee hurled him well nighe foure paces from him, both falling downe. But ſcarce had they fallen, when with ſuch courage they roſe that all the behoulders were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed to ſee ſo cruell a battle.</p>
               <p>Nyne woundes hath the <hi>Pagan,</hi> and the one exceeding troubleſome on the thigh. The Greeke hath foure all about the buckling of his armor, two of them dangerous and hys body bruſed and tyred that his legges coulde ſcant ſuſtayne him. A windie noyſe began to ſound throughout the place who the <hi>Moore</hi> of the <hi>Moones</hi> was, iudging him the valian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that ere was ſeen in <hi>Greece:</hi> for by this time the <hi>Pagan</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:91"/>
began to faint by reaſon of his wounded Thighe, whereby his aduerſarie knewe his aduantage ouer him. So long it was argued who it might bee, that euerye one happened rightly on whome in deede it was: For the Emperor <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio</hi> himſelfe commaunded all the Pages to tell the truth. At laſt it was known that the valiant <hi>Moore</hi> was <hi>Roſicler.</hi> It could not be kept ſo cloſe but it came to <hi>Oliuias</hi> hearing who (liuing by louing him) began to bewaile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battle with millions of pearled teares, that ran down the current of her roſed chéekes ſeing in what cruell combate her deare Lorde had put himſelfe and ſo beſmeared with blood. With many out-cries ſhe had deſcended but that the Ladyes ſtayed her. As much griefe for it tormented the good <hi>Trebatio,</hi> that no longer able to with-hould tooke his horſe, when <hi>Phaebus</hi> light was altogether drencht w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the Cauers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weſtern <hi>Ocean:</hi> at what time the two famous warriors cried out for lights. From out the Tent were preſently brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 1000 torches: ſo wearie were either of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſcarcely they were able to ſtand on their féete. Neuer a ſteppe made the <hi>Moore</hi> but with his blood hee left it printed on the graſſe: and the <hi>Greeke,</hi> ſturd not but hee felt a bloody ſweate ouer all his bodye. Great was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage he had ouer the <hi>Pagan,</hi> becauſe of the troubleſome wound of his thigh. At length diſparing of the long fight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Moore</hi> cloſed with his enemie. The <hi>Greeke</hi> well noted it &amp; ſo entred to the wraſtle with more aduiſe then ſtrength: for ere his enemie had tooke hould of him, he had ſtabd his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his left ſhoulder. Out of his hand did the <hi>Maurita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> ſnatch it, and with it would haue had recouered what he did looſe: But the couragious <hi>Greeke</hi> that ſaw himſelfe in ſuch manifeſt da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger had no other remedie, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his left hand ſtrongly to ſtay it, and with his right to take his, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Moores</hi> backe wherewith he had ended his life, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with all thoſe Princes had not then arriued ſaying.</p>
               <p>With-hold I ſay braue Knights, for this is no battle to be ended with ſuch crueltie about a matter of ſo ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
<pb facs="tcp:13977:91"/>
Then came the beauteous <hi>Oliuia</hi> like an angry Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneſſe. The <hi>Greeke</hi> ſeing ſuch Nobilitie before him, could doe no leſſe then withdrawe apart, through the great ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of his friendes. They intreated the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> King to go with them to <hi>Pallace,</hi> where he ſhould be cured, but reputing them all his enemies refuſed it: and rather w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> extreame fayntnes mounting vpon his horſe, hee went out of the Cittie, with the greateſt need of cure that euer knight had, and neuer perſwading himſelfe otherwiſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that his aduerſarie was one of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Princes. In the firſt vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage he arriued at, he ſtayed, where his wounds were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and by his Lady cured, with ſuch care as louers ſtill haue in ſuch caſes: there he continued till he was able to trauell which he did vntill he arriued in his owne Kingdome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending fully to be reuenged on <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> where there was much griefe by reaſon of the wounded Prince. None would his Mother ſuffer to ſpeake with him: So they dreſt him expecting the enſuing day, wherein happened no leſſe battailes then in the laſt.</p>

The Ladie gaue it him, wiſhing that her fauour might not hazard, what the <hi>Dacians</hi> valour did aſſure. Notwithſtanding w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſoueraigne Maieſtie he turned the beſt Horſe that the world contained, and with his ſtrong launce hee ſpurred againſt his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

               <p>So he met him with all the power his ſtrength affoorded, that cleane ouer his horſe backe he made him leaue the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his length imprinted on the earth, but quickly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on his feet, he had recouered his ſaddle before the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> did returne vnto himſelfe.

With the noiſe of many Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and high prayſes wherewith the popularity celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ruſſett Knight <hi>Don Eleno</hi> with both ſheeldes went where the famous <hi>Bembo</hi> had hung vp his, (in whoſe place) taking away that hee ſet his Ladies, leauing the Greeke Nobilitie of Lordes, and Ladies penſiue in gueſſing who both they might be.

By this time a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant knight had leapt into the Liſts, yet in more deſpayring colours of any that day ſeene: for he was all in yellow, and blacke with ſome barres of a ſad ruſſet, on his ſhield he had a Ladie at whoſe feete himſelfe lay all alonge, with this <hi>motto.</hi>

the <hi>Dacian</hi> looſe his raines, and hould by his horſe necke, if at his turning he ſaw his aduerſarie on the ground, though quickly he leapt into his ſaddle: he pittied him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the time, when comfortleſſe accompanied with nought but deſpaire to eaſe his torments, hee wandered through the world in that manner. So hee craued his pardon requeſting him to accept him for a friend. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally was the yellowe Knight eſteamed for the braue encounter hee had made, and to ouerthrow him was alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die iudged impoſſible, ſo furious &amp; ſo lucky did the Louer raunge about the yarde.</p>
               <p>A ſudden rumour, buz'd through the place, with the entring into it of one of the gallanteſt Gyants in the vniuerſe, and ſo loaden with fearefull weapons, that the fartheſt of yet thought himſelfe within his armes.

               <p>On his ſhield hee had figured a Tower, wherein a faire Ladie ſeemed to bee incloſed, himſelfe ſtanding at the Gate with that huge Mace: and about this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe were theſe wordes inrowled.</p>

Forwards ſtept the courteous <hi>Pagan,</hi> and knowing him in the Ruſſet to be Couſin to him he highly honored, was vnwilling in any thing to moue him, and ſo ſaid, your admired valour (Sir knight) is ſo highly knowen that none dares hazard his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation on the breaking of a Launce againſt you: If I may intreat, ſuffer me to runne on with your Companion, rather to ſhew I am all in all yours, then otherwiſe to offend you. Well did the haughtie Matrone vnderſtand it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the whole place heard what the Gyant had ſaid, thereby more eſteaming the Ruſſet Knight. The Iouſt did the Lady demaund of her beloued Lord, with feare ynough did hee giue it her, and his ſhield with his ſoule. None in all the place did miſ-imagine of the knights hardineſſe in the white though his companion ſeemed of a ſtronger conſtitution: But ſhe that fetcht her Pedegree from <hi>Hercules,</hi> for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter did encourage her ſelfe, and ſo turning her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer with no leſſe grace then her louer, they encountred with aſmuch furie as the god of warre could haue done.

               <p>There no longer lingred the gallant <hi>Brandafidell,</hi> but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leaue of the Ladie (leauing her in opinion of vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant) he went ſtraight to the Theater, and leaping from his beaſt, he alighted the Ladie twixt his armes, moſt ioyfull to ſee her ſelfe before her lord <hi>Meridian</hi> all her deare Father. By her hand did the courteous Gyant lead her vp ſtaires, til euerie one knowing who they were, ſeeing <hi>Roſicler</hi> riſe (though very weake of his laſt battle) they did the like to accompanie him. Along paſt the gentle <hi>Brandafidell</hi> ſaying I am ſorrie (moſt excellent Princeſſe) that bringing ſuch

Verie gladly woulde I haue you tell mee (Prince of <hi>Grecia</hi>) the cauſe of your ſorrowe, For I feare your euill doth proceede of Loue,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:95"/>
yf ſo? and the Ladye bee amonge vs, and my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in anye thinge to fauour you, may I but know hee, and I will doe it in reſpect, I am ſo much indebted to your vncle <hi>Roſicler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt excellent Queene (anſwered the afflicted Lorde) my infirmitie is of ſuch equalitie, that I knowe no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for it, for to nominate the cauſe therof, is a newe torment to augment it. For that to doe ſo is certainelye to offende. This onelye doe I knowe that I feele the approching of a longe lingring death, and would yt make an end to come, Oh happie it, and I farre hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyer: For to whome his lyfe is a griefe, his death is a ſweete remedye. I doe not doubt but the tormentes of paynefull paſſions which I ſuffer is well knowne to whom gouernes the powers of my alienated ſoule from my ſelfe, but the vnworthineſſe of my merits doth withhold imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited fauour.</p>
               <p>Shee replyed neuer a word for ſhe was ſo free, that for the world ſhee woulde not haue had him been more playner in what ſhee already knewe: yet ſhe remayned glad to ſee her ſelfe ſo ingratefull and to be more intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued, and ſo ſhee ſpake: why then goe with your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to beholde the Iuſtes, for I will tarrie here with theſe our newe-come friendes. Neuer did Louer receaue ſuch a blowe nor on any was ſuch Iniunction impoſed: ſwell did his heart beyonde his limits with ſo rygorous an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that hee could not replye, nor knewe hee where hee was, imagining that her parting him from her wyth ſo ſtraunge a diſdayne, was the ſhutting of the doore againſt all comfort. With no ſuch imaginations did the Lady ſit to looke on the Iuſtes, and with no leſſe glorie did <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> mayntaine them. So returning to the liſtes ſhe ſawe afore her a Knight in azure armor, croſſe bard wyth yellowe, his deuiſe was iealouſly in her naturall lyname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, with this <hi>Motto.</hi>

                  <l>Is't not pittie to behold,</l>
                  <l>That no fayth now preuaileth,</l>
                  <l>Whilſt true loue is controld:</l>
                  <l>By iealouſie that moſt auaileth.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Euery one well noted the Iealous deuiſe of the Knight, &amp; the grace wherwith he paſt forwards, till the theater where he did his dutie with more Maieſtie then ioye: It not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle auailed her towards the Iuſtes (for this was <hi>Sarmacia</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Troians</hi> loue) to looke aloft to the windowes, for there ſhee ſpyed her welbeloued Lord ſitting next to the Emperor <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phebo,</hi> and on the farther ſide the beauteous <hi>Floralinda</hi> in pleaſing conuerſation diſcourſing with her <hi>Meridian.</hi> She ſtraight knewe that was the Ladie which had been cauſe of her griefe, her bigge heart coulde not indure it, but ſhee muſt aſke the firſt ſhee mette, whom that Ladye &amp; Knight were. Shee was anſwered the truth, whereat ſhee concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued exceeding ioye, becomming nowe penitent, for her raſh mideeming, and opprobrious exclaimes, agaynſt her <hi>Oriſtides.</hi> She could not imagine the hower when to ſpeak with him to craue his pardon of what againſt him ſhee had breathed. She returned to the liſtes the ioyfulleſt aliue. I feare the gallant <hi>Roſamond</hi> wil be in ſome danger with her, for her purefied thoughts had to ſuch manner incoraged her that all the place ſeemed too little to mayntaine her. At her approching the <hi>Calidonian</hi> Matrone with ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming choller ſayd.</p>
               <p>In fayth Sir Knight if from the ſight of Ladies, you doe attract your ſtrength you may already aſſure your ſelfe the victorie: though hauing ſo little daye, for the much that is to bee done, you might for this preſent haue deferd your ſight, by ſhortening the beholders hopes.</p>
               <p>There is not ſo little tyme (replyed the gallant <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macia</hi>) but will ſuffice to make you knowe the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipte that doth poſſeſſe you. Shee aunſwered not (for her anger woulde not permit it) ſaue wyth turning of her
<pb facs="tcp:13977:96"/>
horſe ſhe went where the launces were, and choſe her ſelfe a ſtrong and knottie one, and more ſwifter then any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumne winde, looſing the raynes of her Courſer ſhe ranne againſt her aduerſarie, who to méete her did the like. Fiue launces brake the <hi>Heroyke</hi> Ladies, ere aduantage was betwene them knowne.</p>
               <p>At the Sixt (for the Iudges told them they might runne no more) with newe forces they ſeemed to incounter wyth ſuch furie that their blowes made all the ſcaffoldes in the place tremble with the noyſe. Her ſtirroppes and brydle loſt our <hi>Roſamond,</hi> and was fayne with the vtmoſt of her ſtrength to holde by her horſe necke, which was a haynous matter to commit that fault before her deare Lorde, and ſo ſhee thought it, yet was ſhee glad, when turning about her Courſer, ſhee ſaw her aduerſarie on the grounde, who thoughe ſhe had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome aduantage fallen yet her horſe eleuating himſelfe made her altogether looſe the recouerie of her ſeate. The other celebrated her victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with admired Maieſtie prawnſing vpp and downe her furious Stéede.</p>
               <p>The hawghtie <hi>Lyrian</hi> Quéene was out of patience to indure it, ſo fayning ſome ſodaine quame, went to her lodging, and ſecretly arming her ſelfe, in a diſguiſed habit and without company went out of the Cittie. She had not gone farre, when ſhee ſpyed comming towardes her three Knightes of gallant diſpoſition, mightily mounted with them alſo came ſome Ladies. The manner of their trauell denoted them to bee of Royall courage. The war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ladye <hi>Archiſilora</hi> with great courteſie ſtept to them with theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>Sir Knights I ſhall accept it as no meane fauour that ſeeing they are twoo which mayntaines the Iuſtes, you would take me in your company, and though in mee there bee no merits to deſerue it, your proper valours may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruaile my wants. Braue ſir (replyed one of them whoſe courteſie knewe no ſuperior in the vniuerſe) your gallant
<pb facs="tcp:13977:96"/>
preſence binds vs to graunt your requeſt, for rather there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are they that receaue ſpeciall honour with your ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie. This kinde reply highly pleaſed the Lady more then before eſteeming the Knights for it. Then this, nothinge more illuſtrateth a Prince. Thus this meſſe of choiſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors began to approch vnto the Citie, they delighting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in the diſguiſed Ladies conuerſation, &amp; ſhee moſt ioyfull, of their braue company. She diſcourſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents befallen in the Iuſtes, and howe it was thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two preſent maintayners would winne the prizes, for their ſhewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> valour witneſſed no leſſe, being thitherto, by none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope. Memorable matters about this time hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For to the place ware arriued two Knightes whoſe hawghty ſemblance drew on themſelues the ſpectators eies. He on the right hand was all in a ſanguine armor of fineſt rubies, intermingled with ſome greene Emeraldes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificentlye it adorned him. His deuiſe on his ſhield was a Knight and a Lady, that ſeemed to giue her portrayture vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her gallant, in whoſe exchange ſhee receaued his. A fayrer thinge was neuer ſeene, for being ſet with ſtones of ineſtimable value, &amp; the Sunne reuerberating thereon it dazled euery eye. Betwene the two Louers was this poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which ſeemed to proceede from the Ladie.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>No faith was ere ſo ſure,</l>
                  <l>But fortune it myght croſſe:</l>
                  <l>By ſome vnhoped loſſe.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Euery one praiſed the Knights inſcription iudging him for a perfect Louer, that for all he was aſſured of his Lady yet hee aſſigned himſelfe to liue amongſt all the ioalouſeſt. The armes of his companion were to his in ſhow and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation nothing inferiour. They were of a deepe red flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb facs="tcp:13977:97"/>
all ouer with many greene enameld flowers ſet with vnualuable ſtones: on his ſhield that was no leſſe rich then the reſt, in a greene fielde, was pictured the face of a moſte beauteous Ladie, in ſuch maner as if through certen trees he gazed on her, yeilding his libertie to her captiuitie at that ſight, his word was.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Well may the heauens change,</l>
                  <l>But my Loue nere ſhall range,</l>
                  <l>Though all my hopes forſake me.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Together paſt they their courſe till they came to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, where they made their horſes bend their knees to the ground, and they their heades lower then their ſaddle bowes.</p>
               <p>None of all thoſe Princeſſes but anſweared them with like courteſie, iudging the Knights worthy of it. After they rayſed themſelues, the firſt they met was with the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Floralinda,</hi> and <hi>Brandafidell</hi> that then newly came to her where they were and ſaid, I would not (Soueraigne Princeſſe of <hi>Macedonia</hi>) now you ſee the carriage of your thoughts anchored in a quiet harbour ſecure from any more vnquiet ſtormes, haue it bee any cauſe to baniſh <hi>Brandafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi> out of your remembrance: for as the ſeruice done to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, brings with it on the perfourmance his recompence, ſo ſtraight they ſhake him off, thinking they wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the very memorie of it. So euill was not your companie braue <hi>Brandafidell</hi> replyed the Princeſſe, that I ſhoulde forget howe well you executed the function of a Ladies keeper, binding not only my ſelfe but my Lord the Prince for it. In their ſoules reioyced her reputed Children to heare their chatte, yet they doubted that it was not ſo, ſuppoſing that being ſo their wiſe friend, <hi>Lupercio</hi> would haue ſuffitientlye reſolued them of it, and not ſuffer that ſo openly they ſhould publiſh themſelues mortall foes vnto
<pb facs="tcp:13977:97"/>
the Greeks, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this imagination they terminated all their deſires rather to remaine enemies to <hi>Greece,</hi> then ſonnes to <hi>Miridian:</hi> As in truth both they were being <hi>Don Celyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> and <hi>Floraliza,</hi> that parting from the hawghtie <hi>Tynacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> they arryued in the Cittie to make knowen their valour. They turned their horſes to the liſtes againſt the maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the furious Lady thus ſayd. The time is ſo ſhort ſir Knight to Iuſt conſidering how many expectes it, that I haue thought it good that in the open field (ſeeing wee are foure, two to two, we trie the fauour of the changing God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe. For that matter as you pleaſe ſir Knight (replyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faire <hi>Roſamond</hi>) for we are onely here to performe what ere is demaunded vs. Now you ſee (ſir Knight ſayde <hi>Don Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindo</hi>) that our Iuſting being without the liſtes our battle of the ſwordes is not prohibited. Not far from thence was the gallant <hi>Eleno</hi> that not a little ioying thereat replyed. I perceaue (ſir Knights) how by little and little you haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to vs your mindes challenging vs with ſo many Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which indeede were needeleſſe, for by plainely aſking wee had made anſwered with going into the field. Great is the confidence you haue of your valour (ſayde <hi>Don Celindo.</hi>) Not ſo much (replied <hi>Don Eleno</hi>) as is your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, to demaund in triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phs what none elſe hath done. Nere them ſtood the braue <hi>Aſtorildo</hi> of <hi>Calidonia</hi> brother to <hi>Roſamond</hi> with <hi>Hercules</hi> ſhielde, for onely foure were ſo good in the place. The Ladie knewe him well, for the heate had made him lift vppe his Beuer. And ſo becauſe ſhe would not take hers from whence it was, ſhe demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iudges if according to the Greeke lawes, ſhe might require a ſhield before the beginning of any particuler quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell? who anſwering ſhee might, made no more a doe but went to her brother and in her language ſaid. May it pleaſe you braue Prince to lend me your ſhield, for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch a fauor I doe not doubt, but my enterprize will haue a happie ende. As hee ſpake it in her language and ſomewhat highe, the
<pb facs="tcp:13977:98"/>
gallant <hi>Aſtorildo</hi> thought it was his ſiſter, and in this doubt with great liberalitie he gaue it her ſaying. All my armor weapons and my ſelfe Sir knight are for euer at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, for your voice bindes me to more then this: and in faith it gets immortall honor by the change: without more ceremonies the Ladie humbled her ſelfe, yet ſaid that after the Iuſts ſhe would ſpeake with him which was a verefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his doubt. From him went the beauteous Ladie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliuering to her Lord his owne ſhield. If at anye time (faire Miſtreſſe, to whome my ſoule hath vowed perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obedience) I had extreame need of your fauoures, it is the preſent wherein my Fortune hath put me in to deſcribe ſuch famous Iuſts as in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> great Citie happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. None ſtirred, with dumbe ſilence euery one expected the end of the ſwift Carrier of the Foure Worthies. Here Fortune ſeemed to fauoure <hi>Don Celindo,</hi> that ſéeing hee ſhould looſe by the match it might be at <hi>Roſamonds</hi> hands that with more furie then the fierie Comet renteth the clowdes ſhe met him. In the place was not thetherto heard a greater noiſe then in their cloſure they made, breaking their launces with ſuch eaſe as if they were of Canes, and ſo knockt each other with their ſhieldes and helmes. On the ground out of his ſaddle did <hi>Don Cellindo</hi> finde himſelfe with the bridle in his hand, with more remembraunce, (though on foote) then the Ladie had on horſe backe: for houlding by his necke hauing loſt both raynes and ſtirrops, he paſt forward with ſuch furie, that it was a wonder he did not leape out of the Liſts: ſhe recouered her ſelfe aſtoniſhed at the mightie blowe, a greater than it was not giuen in all the Iuſts. Euerie one agreed in the ſtrength of the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers: But the praiſes wherewith the popularitie exalted the twoo Louers, may not eaſilie be credited: For the braue <hi>Dacian</hi> with incomparable ſtrength encountred the Lady in the middeſt of her amorous breaſt: he did not wound her, for that honor was only reſerued for <hi>Cupid</hi> to triumph ouer her captiue life: yet he met her with ſuch rigor, that he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb facs="tcp:13977:98"/>
her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſeate cleane ouer her Courſers backe, which guided by the bridle threwe her on the earth, with ſlow pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did the Prince of <hi>Dacia</hi> paſſe along without ſtirroppes: And <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> ſayth that till hee well returned to himſelfe, he did not recouer them. There was nothing could be heard in all the place, for the noiſe of millitarie Inſtruments: till the comming of a companie of Ladies and Knightes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gaue occaſion to enioy the ſight of their gallant preſence. They were to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> number of 12 Ladies all apparelled in gréen Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet, ymbroydered with gold twiſt vpon red Taffata, braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mounted on white palfraies, and their faces maſked. In the middle of them came a Ladie whoſe diſpoſition denoted her to be commandreſſe of the others, as the reſt, ſhe had w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a vaile couered her Angelicall face, her habit was of Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with many Hartechokes imboſt with ſtones of infinite eſtimation, her attire was of the <hi>Egiptian</hi> manner with many foldes concluding in two ends, which fell ouer either ſhoulder. A mantle of Purple ueluet ſhee wore lyued with <hi>Salamander</hi> ſkinnes, whoſe facing was imbroydered wyth many Thouſand rich Orient pearles. With them came 4 Knights whoſe conſtitution admired the beholders. Arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, two by two they paſt their courſe with ſuch Maieſtie, that there was none but wiſht them the prizes of the Iuſts. Of the firſt two hee on the right hande, that ſéemed of more ſtrength, was all in armor quartered in gréene and azure with many ſtones that marueilouſly adorned it. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his ſhield was ſet the picture of Amitie, as in antient times ſhe was paynted in forme of thrée Ladies, her in the middle all naked, and ſhee on the right ſide, halfe couered, and the other altogether, with this word.</p>

So little it is ſince our company hath arryued in his Countrey (moſt excellent Prince) that it knowes not the conditions of the Iuſtes: And ſo for that I haue farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence ſeene you, and ſo long acknowledged you for my Lord vnto the death I doe beſéech you to tell vs what herein is wonne or loſt. The voice that was impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his ſoule the Gréeke ſéemed to remember, &amp; therefore with ſome alteration he made anſwere. Theſe tryumphes (gracious Knight) are to pleaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies, for their gallants doe delight to hazarde their liues in of celebrating their gallantneſſe: And ſo may you Iuſt, though I am ſure your valour will want matter to extend it ſelfe vpon intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting you that ere you depart, you will ſpeake vnto mee, for I beléeue we haue in ſome place been alone with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.

I ſhall not néede (ſwéete Ladies) to pray your attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for this war being for beauty, I ſhold not perſwade you to it: yet being néedy in witt, and hauing none, but with laborious toyle. Whats drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing current of your fauors I muſt ſtill implore it, without which in a ſwéet &amp; pleaſant ſtile ill canne I paynt forthwith wordes, ſuch amorous, (though rigorous) blowes as heere were giuen. The two warlike louers oppoſed themſelues in their Carrier while the <hi>Mirror</hi> of beauty &amp; her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion did the like. They prickt forth ſwifter then an aierie thought. None miſt the incounters, for rather they were made with more horror, then the roaring <hi>Baſeliſkes</hi> do make. They paſſe (ſhiuering their launces in a thouſand pieces) by each other, with ſuch grace, that loue himſelfe they inamored; ſetting downe alſo principles of war, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty God of battles, which he ſemed not to diſdaine euen in his fift throne. They turned about, but with ſuch fury that the fartheſt remooued looker on trembled at the view. They drewe foorth the beſt blades in the world, &amp; the two louers cloſed to wound each other, but there ſwords fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their armor rebou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpwards. Their dexteritie inwards diſliked them, ſuppoſing it impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their valour, ſo they ſeconded their blows w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch wrath that their heads kiſt their ſaddle bowes. Longer had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> vſed his weapons, and was by nature couragious: but the gallant <hi>Britanian</hi> youth admits no comparatiue, for al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place admired his ligeritie. Againe they ioyned, aſtoniſhed that their ſwords did not cut. Aloft offered the <hi>Greeke</hi> his blow hauing an eye ſtill at his ayme, &amp; as his ſtrength was exceeding in the middeſt of his race he ſtayed, turning it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and diſcharging it, he made him ſée a number num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe of ſtars doubling him vpon his horſe back. At large on his breſt he gaue him another, that had not <hi>Brutus</hi> armor defended him hee had inlarged his impriſoned ſoule. A raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:13977:100"/>
Tygre nor angred Lyon depriued of his pray, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeen more furious then the <hi>Dacian</hi> did become, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enemie neere hee let flie at him twoo thruſtes one after another that they left him breathleſſe, they guyrded hym ſo ſorylie hee had not executed them, when caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his ſhielde, on the ſide of his helme hee gaue him ſuch a counterbuffe, that it made him turne his head more then he willingly woulde haue done. Of a long time had not <hi>Greece</hi> been witneſſe to a fiercer combate, for the haſtening of their blowes, their warding, aſſaulting, and retires, a larger Chapter doe require. Giue me leaue (ſwéete La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) to tell you what paſſed betweene the twoo Matrones who like mountaine Lyoneſſes the one againſt the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with their raiſed ſwords. Little gets the Quéene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> for <hi>Roſamond</hi> weares y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt arms &amp; weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe, for which cauſe ſhe cut away al her plumed top, with halfe of her ſtéeled circuit, and a peece of her ſhielde. Better did ſhe not ſpeed, with the blowe ſhe receaued, for voyding much blood through her viſor ſhe caſt her ouer her horſe croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: ſhe ſeconded another when ſhe would riſe with no leſſe force, ſhe had no other remedie but outwards to put foorth her ſhield whereon it lighted, being a wonder ſhe let it not fall ſo tormented remained her arme. Shee entred againe with a point, which <hi>Roſamond</hi> extreamely felt, ſo ſure was her reuenge that ere ſhe retired, ſhe ſtrucke her on the ſide of the helme, ſhe ſomewhat ſlackned her arme, for elſe ſhe had mortally wounded her, but to the cruell ſwoord the hardeſt ſteele ſeemes ſofteſt waxe. The imperious guider of the higheſt Orbes protected them to be inſtruments of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in defence of his afflicted people, for elſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thruſt the <hi>Gallidonian</hi> let fly, ſhe had ended that buſineſſe. On the out ſide ſhe cut away all the harneſſe vnder the arme making the furious blade appeare on the other part. All the place had thought her to be ſlaine, the like imagined <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond:</hi> whereupon ſpurring her Courſer, ſhee would haue parted without payment, but ſhe thought it too late: for the
<pb facs="tcp:13977:101"/>
Quéene ſéeing her chance, and amazed at the cutting edge of her aduerſaries ſword, with all her ſtrength ſhe gaue her a blow that made her make a thouſand ſignes of falling, and altogether ſhe had ouerthrowne her but that ſhe feared the cruell ſlicing blade. She procured to helpe her ſelfe with her dexteritie: but it little auailes her, for though the <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Ladie be ſhort winded, &amp; her face within her helme beſmeared with blood: yet euery time ſhe reacht her, ſhe cut both the armour and the moſt faireſt ſkinne that the world did know. O <hi>Claridiano,</hi> who ſhould approch thee with ſuch newes, that the blood which thou moſt adoreſt doth enamell the ſmalleſt graſſe? Ouerwhelmed in the ſtudie of confuſed thoughts was the Loue-burning youth, to ſee with what crueltie hee was entreated by his Ladie, that hee neither heard, nor ſaw what in the field was done. Hard by him ſat the beauteous Engliſh <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> who ſeeing him in ſuch penſiuenes pluckt him by the arme with theſe wordes, why how now (excellent Prince) is it poſſible there ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loue ſhould ſo eſtrange you? if you pleaſe to participate your greefe with me, receauing it to eaſe you therof, it will be my content: and in faith it is no ſmall paine what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue to ſée you in theſe paſſions. As fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſlepe newly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, did the afflicted youth looke vp, and hearing what that beauteous Lady had offered, made this replie. I doe moſt humblie kiſſe your Soueraigne handes (moſt Soueraigne Princeſſe) for the fauour done me, in pittying what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, yet is it but a ſmall comfort: for in the ſtrangeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath crueltie plaſte it ſelfe (to my more plague) in our place, and my thoughts in another laboured in their ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing dutie (ſetting apart all other things) to procure at once one death, a momentarie remedie for a long and pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Why then be aſſured (ſaid the Lady) that this frenſie of Loue is made gentle being tollerated, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with one that will, like my ſelfe ridde you of it. In all things (replied the woefull Louer, hath Fortune fauoured me, animating my weakenes by ſo on high ſublimating my
<pb facs="tcp:13977:101"/>
hopes: only it hath giuen me as a Croſſe to this glorie the greateſt euill that could be, ſéeing I am comaunded &amp; bound by a conſtant faith, to reueale my griefes to none. I féele it though well conſidered, it is my peace: For diſcouering the cauſe thereof, the preſent anſwere canne be no other, then that my torments are too eaſie waighed with her merites. So haue I choſe in my bargaine, to ſuffer and be ſilent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your noble offer ſhall not want his due regard in the duties of my loue: why then (ſaid the Ladie) I ſhall not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye more neede to importune you about the procéeder of your griefes. But for this tyme leaue wee it to looke on the battaile of you foure Knights, for valianter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth doth not containe. Your highnes hath reaſon for it (replyed he) for they that are newe come eſpecially he of the flowers is the ſooneſt in aſſaulting, that I haue ſeene, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooues him combating with a Knight that ſo warylie maks his battle, as hee in the Ruſſet: And beléeue me I would gladly knowe his companion whoſe armor doth aſſure him what the others ſtrenghth cannot looſe. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this were they interrupted: for <hi>Roſabell</hi> thinking it towardiſe that a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhoulde ſo longe laſt in preſence of his Fathers, lyke ſtormes of hayle threwe his blowes vppon his aduerſarie, which breathleſſe made him almoſt goe vp and downe. A wraſtling would the <hi>Dacian</hi> verie faine haue been at, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to get more aduantage: but the Gréeke that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued his intent ſuffered him to enter, and in his cloſing, with all his ſtrength thruſt at him betweene the ioynts of his armes harneſſe, he wounded him, and with a litle more he had toucht the harts ſide, but turning about he caſt it outwards, and becomming more fierce then a Bazeliſke, caſting his ſhield at his backe, with his handes he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſword and diſcharged it on the Burgonet of <hi>Lirianas</hi> gallant louer, it ſtrucke him ſenceleſſe vpon his horſe, filling his helme full of blood which ran fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Beuer &amp; noſtrels. A better blow was not giuen in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battle. Well was it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallant Quéene, that not a litle affected y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight of
<pb facs="tcp:13977:102"/>
the Flowers both for his valour and courteſie. She would needes helpe him, ſo driuing <hi>Roſamond</hi> with a point apart ſideling with her horſe ſhee aſſaulted <hi>Don Eleno</hi> to wound him. She got little by it, for the <hi>Dacian</hi> was nimbler, and ſtronger than ſhee, and mounted on that Courſer, it was nothing to make her bow vnto his breſt with the blowe hee gaue her at her entring: and as ſhe aroſe (he ſtill hauing the ſword between his hands) did let it flie at her: the powers of heauen defended her, for elſe (ſo rigorous was the blow) ſhe had been parted in two. All the corner of the ſhéeld was ſtruck away, he wounded her on the ſhoulder, and cut the great band of her helme, with part of her necke péece, and made her tremble like an aſpen leafe. Then arriued the <hi>Callidonian</hi> Ladie, and betweene them they hadde ſurely ſlaine her: but ſhe ſtaied her ſword thinking it cowardiſe to offend any with aduantage. By this was the furious youth come to himſelfe making againſt them. Before him ſtept the Lady, but with him ſhee could get nothing, for in all thinges they were vnequall: he let flye at the toppe of her burgonet ſuch a blow, that ſhe thought ſhe ſawe the ſtarrie firmament. Like to a rauening Tygre ſhe rayſed her aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſword, whoſe inchauntment being made long afore any other, there is no defence in <hi>Hectors</hi> ſhield, for a peece ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe caſt to the earth. She came with another at his head, he warded it fearing the ſwoord, elſe had he fared ill, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it extreamely oppreſt him. In himſelfe was not the amorous Lord ſéeing ſo mightie enemies: impatient is hee of delaie, his ſhield he hurles at his backe, and with both handes hee reacht her, (though not at full) vppon her rich helme, it, next to the deuine powers ſaued her life, for to the ſaddle bowes it had otherwiſe diuided her: without ſence or féeling it caſt her vppon them, voyding infinite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of bloode through her helme, and was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way about the field on her horſe. O <hi>Don Eleno</hi> what didſt thou féele, ſeing the thing thou moſt louedſt in the world in ſuch danger? Againſt <hi>Oliuias</hi> ſonne he caſt himſelfe who
<pb facs="tcp:13977:102"/>
truſting to his <hi>Bollador</hi> ſtayed to receaue him, but hee mett with the <hi>Dacians Tyrio</hi> that almoſt had ouerthrowne them both, he made him ſet his buttocks on the ground. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and admirable bountie of the warriors had ſuſpended the iudgment of euery one, not knowing on whether part to decline, not daring ſo much as mutter, fearing to looſe the ſight of ſome notable blowe that might be giuen. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furious <hi>Callidonian</hi> Dame, recouered her ſelfe ſhee woulde haue confronted him that had indangered her. Shee left yt doubting to diſpleaſe her beloued Lord. And therefore ſhee turned all her wrathfull furie on the famous Quéene of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:</hi> who ſeing her come, did not leaue to expect her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome doubt of her accurſed blade. She came with ſuch eagernes that her blowe was not worthy the giuing, but rather the Quéene vnwilling to looſe that occaſion, as ſhee paſt with both handes layde at her ſhoulder. Twas a good blow for the end, becauſe it cut all the buckles of her helme on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſyde. She returned aſhamed to haue miſt her ſtroake, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all her force with more aduiſe ſtrucke at her ſhield. Tis no defence againſt the cutting ſwoord, for cleane a ſunder yt was dyuided, doing the like with the pointe on her breſt, a little wounding her arme. From her did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warlike Quéene caſt the remaynder of her ſhield, and diſcharged the fury of her armes on her helme which at one ſide looſe. So much it wayghed downe on the other, that ſhe ſtrucke it, from her head couering the white armour, of her more whiter ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with goulden tramells of Amber haire. More fayrer lookes not <hi>Apollo</hi> when hee beautifies the world with the Eaſterne vpriſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morne, or in his pride within his mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day courſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lady ſeme without her precious helme. All the field was in an vproare to ſée ſo faire a Lady and ſo valiant.</p>
               <p>It not grieued her to be without helme, for with both handes ſhee ſtrucke the Quéene on her viſor. It made her a ſmall wound, but the payne was greater, which gaue <hi>Roſamond</hi> leaue as ſwift as an Eagle to cloſe with
<pb facs="tcp:13977:103"/>
her and with great ſtrength and ſpéed ſnatcht at hers, that when ſhe awaked ſhe was without it, amazed to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in that manner. Euery one applauded with praiſes the Ladies battaile who afeard to hurte one another helde themſelues faſt imbraced with their armes, that I knowe not what hart would not ioy to be bound with ſuch gyues. The Combatants were aſtoniſhed at the ſucceſſe, but <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> moſt of all with the ſight of <hi>Roſamond,</hi> thinking he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on his deare <hi>Liriana:</hi> either of them woulde goe to aid his partener, but the <hi>Dacian</hi> that was aſſured of his Ladies ſtrength, diſturbed him from it by caſting his armes about his necke: euery one that was looking from the windowes, deſcended. O <hi>Claridiano</hi> from the toppe of the ſcaffold to the ground didſt thou thinke it a long iourney? with a ſudden amazement did the ſight of his Ladie aſſault him, and ſeing her in that danger, the ſwiftnes of a towring Faulcon is ſlow to his, for not knowing what he did, with a leape hee iumpt downe to the ground, making no kinde of ſiniſter motion thereat, which admired both Ladies and beholders, and went ſtraight to the warlike Matrones. Well did <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabell</hi> note it, iudging it for a ſtrange acte. By this was the Nobilitie coming to them, ſo the Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi> ſeing the Emperour, ſaid, for this time faire Ladie, canne wee not end our battaile: but we ſhall not want another time to doe it. When you will (replied <hi>Roſamond</hi>) for it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we ſhould thus longer continue, you being knowen in Court: ſo they demaunded their helmes of ſome that were by, and went to the Knights intreating them to giue ouer, which they preſently accorded to. The Emperour then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued: for <hi>Claridiano,</hi> hauing bethought him on what hee had done, was rather ſorey for it, and that it ſhould not be noted he went to <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> his beautie both the <hi>Dacian</hi> and <hi>Roſabell</hi> admired, whome he intreated to leaue the battaile. Seing our friends haue ſo done (braue Sir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Roſabell</hi>) we cannot but heere make an end.</p>
               <p>They went ſtraight to the Emperour that imbraced <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſilora</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:103"/>
with ſuch woordes. In faith (gallant Ladie) I ſhall neuer ceaſe my complaintes of you, ſéeing in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence you hazarded your deare perſon in ſuch manifeſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill.</p>
               <p>There is none (moſt mightie Monarch replyed ſhee) Combating with ſo haughtie a Dame, whoſe blowes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from her handes, were eaſie to be ſuffered. Let vs knowe who ſhe is (ſaid the Emperour,) for I hope ſhe will not ſo wrong vs, as to goe away without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge. By that time all the reſt came thither accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Claridiano:</hi> Being neere together <hi>Don Eleno</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his Helme went to the Emperour, and on his knees proſtrated ſaid.</p>
               <p>I haue (moſt mightie Monarch) ſo feared to fall into your diſgrace, that I muſt (ere I am commaunded) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech your pardon, and alſo intreate your Highnes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and commaund mee as one of your owne Sonnes: preſentlie did the Grand <hi>Trebatio</hi> knowe him, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with more than an Vncles loue imbracing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him vppe, ſaid: Conſidering how you angred mee (good Couze) in the Kingdome of <hi>Cimarra,</hi> it were not much I ſhoulde continue ſo ſtill: But you haue ſo well ſalued it, with honouring at this time our Court, both you and your companion, that a farre greater fault then that ſhould be forgiuen you.</p>
               <p>I beſeech your Maieſtie (ſayde hee) to ſpeake vnto the Princeſſe of <hi>Callidonia,</hi> that is here preſent. So ſoone as he had ſo ſayde ſhe had vnlaced her helme, knéeling before him to require the kiſſing of his handes. The Emperour would not conſent it, but doing her like courteſie ſaid.</p>
               <p>She that hath them ſo admirable (Soueraigne Lady) ought of duetie require this of all the earth: For thys honour that my Court receaueth could not come from no other. A content hath this been ſo great, which (for it will be) I would haue Fortune water it but with ſome ſmal
<pb facs="tcp:13977:104"/>
diſcontent, though I feare ſhe will not reſpect it. But let vs to the Empreſſe, for ſhee muſt not looſe what the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens haue ſent vs. Euen where you will I in all thinges obay your commaund. So they began to march towardes the Theater, where by the way the two Ladies, receaued each other as befitted their Royalties, and hand in hand w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their helmes they followed the Emperor. Great vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce was amonge the popularitie whether of the Dames were fayreſt. Many inclined to <hi>Roſamond,</hi> for being ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing younger a naturall white and red ſeemed more to flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh on her, but the Queenes graue perfections bewitched euery vnderſtanding. Thitherto had not <hi>Roſabell</hi> put of his helme, though excéeding glad to ſée that great Emperour, whome he accompted his Grande-father. By that was <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicler</hi> come, yet ſomewhat weake, who thinking him to bee his deare Sonne thus ſayd.</p>
               <p>Now is the time (ſir Knight) you muſt performe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you made me, to ſpeake to vs ere you departed, I am (anſwered he) and will be alwaies moſt ready to obay you (moſt excellent Prince) but yonder ſtands the Knight (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Tartare</hi> ouer-ioyed to ſe his friends) to whome I gaue my word not to vnlace my helme, vnleſſe it be in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the Court, for he will haue it ſo to doe the like. Be it ſo (replyed the Father of the ſuppoſed Sonne) for here will we all onely procure your content. Straight went they to the Royall pallace that ſtoode not farre from thence, firſt agréeing that the prizes of the Iuſtes ſhoulde remaine at the two Ladies diſpoſing. They for <hi>Roſilueras</hi> ſake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them on the Ladies that in the beginning were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorers of the Tryumphes they were <hi>Claridiana, Oliuia, Roſiluera,</hi> and <hi>Artemiſa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This decrée was with admiration applauded, and with the noyſe of all ſortes of Muſicke they were all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uayde out of the place. Being arryued in the great Hall their receauinges beganne anewe whoſe prolixitie doth not <hi>Lir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gandeo</hi> ſet downe nor what paſt among the Ladies with
<pb facs="tcp:13977:104"/>
their newe come gueſt, moſt of whome remayned enuious of her beautie. So when they were all quyet, the three newe and faythfull friendes, <hi>Roſabell</hi> the <hi>Tartare,</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoldo</hi> with the beauteous <hi>Tigliaffa,</hi> went towardes the Emperour, and their dueties done, <hi>Lirianas</hi> couragious lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thus began.</p>
               <p>Comming ſome fewe dayes ſince (moſt mighty <hi>Monarch</hi>) vnto thy Court through fame of her greatneſſe, From far Countries, my Fortune brought mee vnto an inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where the Ladye, and Knight (meaning the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare</hi>) were, bereaued of their naturall powers, I indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored with the vtmoſt of my power, (though in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ſhoulde looſe my ſelfe) to procure his libertie. In the ende it pleaſed the Gods, that I (yet with ſome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour) ſhould enfranchize them, hauing done, I intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tell me who they were. They anſwered, that yf they ſhould, I being of ſuch remoted parts could not know them, neuertheleſſe they promiſed to doe it here in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. In recompence whereof I offered them my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and ſeing we are arryued to this paſſe, may it pleaſe thy mightineſſe I may (by thy commaunde) knowe them, for I muſt without delay depart. Here the gallant youth ended together with his awefull duetie, expecting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours anſwere, who contented with the Knightes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, replyed. Hee that hath receaued ſo great good worke at your handes (ſir Knight) will not ſo ill ſatiſfie you as deny you who he is.</p>
               <p>No in faith (anſwered the <hi>Tartare</hi>) for he that ſo greatly is indebted as my ſelfe, with hazarding my life I doe deſire to acknowledge the beginning of my gratitude. Alreadie was the Ladie vnmaſked, and the three valiant warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours without helmes: Beſides himſelfe was the Emperour ſéeing the <hi>Tartare</hi> louing him as any of his ſonns, he imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him ſhedding ſome teares of ioy, and ſaid, Braue Prince the Traytor that kept you ſo long from vs, did nothing loue you as I doe. The Emperour was not ſuffered to ſpeake
<pb facs="tcp:13977:105"/>
any more for all the reſt roſe to welcome the <hi>Tartare.</hi> Oh who might expreſſe without ſome note of tediouſneſſe, what <hi>Oliuia</hi> did with <hi>Roſabell.</hi> Twas long ſince ſhe ſaw him euen ſince ſhe was deliuered of him: but ſcarce he had doft his helme when ſhe knewe him riſing ſwifter then an Eagle to imbrace him, and ſpake without reſpect of her grauetie.</p>

               <p>Oh God forfend it (ſayd the diſſembling Quéene) but tell me, hath not he manifeſted to his Lady the ſorrow &amp; payne that noriſhes him. His eyes (replyed he) are they that ſpeak by ſignes. Why then (ſayde <hi>Roſamond</hi>) ſhee is in Gréece that is cauſe of his maladie.

In the middeſt of his ſhield was the picture of Crueltie, as the <hi>Achayans</hi> were woont to paint her, with foure punniards ſharpe edged on all ſides, &amp; a Knight lying at her féete with many woundes.

A thouſand times was ſhe about to follow him, had ſhee not feared to haue béen noted for it. She left it for another time, paſſing her life in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall laments deſeruedly, ſeing ſhe would not (only to ſhew her ſelfe cruell) liue a ſweet and pleaſant life, in her Louers companie. She could not ſo cloſe couer her griefe, but <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> at length plainely perceaued it, and ſéeing ſhe knewe it, did confeſſe it.

               <p>Oh moſt excellent Knight, now is the time you muſt ſhew your valour, for theron depends the life of the fayreſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe liuing, who againſt all equitie is like to periſh.

It grieued the two friends to part, yet being neceſſary they imbraced one another. The Gréeke intreated him to excuſe him with his Parents and kindred, that he departed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out their leaue. And entring the barke, it cut away with incredible celeritie. Greatly deſired <hi>Roſabell</hi> to haue his owne armour and horſe, but ſeing it could not bee, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelfe with his good ſword hee had with him. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoldo</hi> returned where he had left the Ladies, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to goe backe to the Pallaice, being all there ſauing <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabell</hi> and the Troyan <hi>Oriſtides.</hi> They demaunded for them, whereupon <hi>Oriſtoldo</hi> declared the aduenture that befell his friend.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon they went to the Cittie, whence euery one ordered his departure to their owne Kingdomes. So did the Emperor and Empreſſe of <hi>Trebizound</hi> taking with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Roſiluera</hi> with the beauteous Engliſh <hi>Artemiſa,</hi> and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one aduertiſed of what the wiſe man had writ vnto <hi>Don Eleno.</hi> Onely was left in Court the Gracious <hi>Tartarian Zoylo</hi> with his louing <hi>Tigliaffa,</hi> to whome they tould howe the mighty <hi>Andronio</hi> his couzen did come to ſeeke him, and knowing he was dead returned, whome the <hi>Tartares</hi> hadd Crowned their King.

I thinke you are vniuſtly wronged in reiecting of your woes. You haue (ſir Knight verie ill) vnderſtood my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſaid the Louer) for though the paines I ſuffer be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I make them, the beautie of her that cauſeth them is ſuch, that if euery one were tenne times trebled, it were nothing comparable to her merites: and therefore, haue I ſought the difficulteſt meanes, to make the Ladie ſure, how greatly ſhe is loued: Whereuppon I left my countrey, to come to <hi>Grecia,</hi> to giue her the prizes of the Iuſts I haue heard held in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts, a more harder enterprize (if any be) might be happily accompliſhed: but as for the Iuſts of <hi>Grecia</hi> they are ended, &amp; were the famouſeſt, that any memory can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and I am ſure you had got little there, in reſpect of the valiant Knights that there miſcarried, that reputed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It ſounded like a bell, ſlyding to the ſhoulder, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away the brimme with a péece of the elbow armor. It was ſo heauie that ſhe was faine to ſet her knées vppon the grounde, with a point entred the <hi>More,</hi> thinking to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne her, but the Lady ſeing it come voided it with a turne, making him following his owne ſtrength tumble headlong at her féet.

Shee ſtayed for him, perceauing her aduantage thereby, and as hee would execute his blowe, ſhe entred with a thruſt vnder his armes, making him not onely looſe his blowe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe quicker then hee came, with deſire of ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the beauteous <hi>Sarmacia</hi> followe him, and warding a myghtie blowe that ſhee greatly felt, ſtrucke at his leggs, quicke was the louer, ſo drawing backe his left legg, he made her looſe the blowe, and almoſt the battaile, for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with the furie of her armes, ſhee turned twice about, that ſhee had been lyke to fall, hee helped her with a ſtrong ſtroake on the ſhoulder which wounded her and bounding vpwards it fel on her throat. The valiant Matrone thought it had been mortall. She became of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colour of a red burning cole, and caſting her ſhield to her backe, with both ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:13977:115"/>
ſtrucke him, his ſhield is no defence, for the furious ſword beginning at one end, it ceaſt not till it came out at another a little wounding him on the breſt. Now doth the time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no dexteritie, nor the life of neyther is eſteemed or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much as the death of one anothers aduerſarie. Thrée howers hath the battle laſted, and on neyther ſide appeares no ſhewe of aduantage. At the noyſe they made, did the hawghty <hi>Bembo</hi> arryue to the battle. Straight was he knowen by the Lady through the wounders he had done in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which made her greatly affect him. Meeke and gentle was the mightie <hi>Achayan,</hi> and in him all cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie did floriſh: he neuer ſuffered any battle to procede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee knewe the cauſe: ſo leaping from his horſe, he put himſelfe betwene them, ſaying.</p>
               <p>With-hould awhile braue Knights, and in courteſie tell me the cauſe of ſo fierce a fight, which ſhould not bee ſmall. Thoſe that are proude and haughtie in conceipt (replyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lady) iudge euery occaſion ſuffitient to maintayne an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious and falſe opinion: So this Knight, perſwaded himſelfe the prizes of the Grecian Iuſts were due to him, ſorrowing he had not come in time to them: I tould him it had been no ſmall honour to haue wonne them, for manye had to their coſtes procured it, being as good as he, yet loſt them, he grieued at this truth, and about it is our battayle. Therefore with-drawe you ſir Knight, for it were a ſhame to let him returne to his country with ſuch vaine thoughts. It had well pleaſed the gallant Lord of <hi>Achaya,</hi> and alſo to take the battle on himſelfe, as one being particularly wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therein, yet would he not ſuffer it, ſeing them ſo ſorely wounded, and that thereby nothinge was expected but the death of one or both. So hee replyed, thanking her for her courteous relation.</p>
               <p>Suffitient was the occaſion (ſir Knight) for many more battailes then this: Neuertheleſſe I ſhall receaue ſpeciall fauour, that for my ſake you would giue it ouer. In more then this (replyed ſhe) doe I deſire (ſir Knight) to ſhewe yt
<pb facs="tcp:13977:115"/>
you, and if this Knight be pleaſed, I am content to leaue. He will he will ſaid <hi>Bembo:</hi> doe not ſo raſhly iudge (reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enraged <hi>Pagan</hi>) and for all the Greeke Empire will I not leaue this battaile: therefore get you from vs, for it would be my laſting diſhonour to giue ouer the firſt battaile I vndertake for my Ladie: you will not ſo diſcontent vs (ſaid <hi>Bembo</hi>) chiefely I intreating you, it will be to aſſault you both (ſaid he) yf you leaue me not, and ſo made as if he would ſtrike him: more furious was not <hi>Hercules</hi> among the Centaures, then the <hi>Achayan</hi> being angred, ſo ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fier from his eyes, he ſaid. I would I had found thee at more eaſe diſcourteous Knight, to teach thee how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the intreatie of thy betters: let not that greeue thee, (ſaid he) for in me there is ſuffitient mettle for an hardier enterprize: and not regarding any thing gaue him a mighty blow vppon his helme. Ioues ſword drewe hee foorth that deſcended from him, and with the ſtrength the heauens had giuen him, he diſcharged his furie on his helme, he cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a peece, and with a dangerous wound he ſtrucke him ſenceleſſe at his feet. He left him and turning to the Ladie, ſaid, forgiue mee valiant Knight, for his diſcourteſie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs farre worſe deſerued: better handes then yours could not he haue met (anſwered ſhee) to be aſſured of his owne follie, &amp; let vs from hence, for his being alone may be occaſion to driue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his deceipt. They went where the Lady had her horſe, going fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence by reaſon of the ſwift current of water that ranne that way, till they came to a freſh meade where the brooke did ſpring, there they alighted, letting their horſes féede on the greene graſſe. The Ladie was ſomething wearie, and with her face ſomewhat blody, which made her put of her helme to waſh it of in the ſpring. The valiant <hi>Bembo</hi> had not noted her to be a woman, ſo did the ſight ſuddenly ſurprize him, that had he not been ſo yoked to the beauteous <hi>Liriana,</hi> ſurely ſome other had cured him: for this Ladie was of the faireſt in the world, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſéene her valour, might haue moued any ones affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:116"/>
yet was he a little amazed, &amp; though applyed Phiſicke doth not altogether heale, yet at leſt it takes away ſome hurting quames. Remembring himſelfe with a chéerefull looke, he ſayd. In faith valiant Ladie, I muſt néeds confeſſe, I wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your beauty, in taking the battaile from yonder Knight, ſince by the one, and by the other your honour was ſo great. Shee anſwered. I would not ſir Knight haue you ſo ſoone ſhew your ſelfe againſt me, ieſting at that little the heauens haue on you imparted, the which my good wil to worke your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent deſerueth not, ſpecially ſince I ſaw you at the Iuſts in <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> where I had been glad you had ſtayed to ſee the end of them, that you might not be deceaued with my little beauty, in that againſt ſo many Knights as thither came, two Ladies wonne the prizes, whoſe rare beauties made <hi>Cinthia</hi> pale, and <hi>Venus</hi> blacke, and I thinke <hi>Mars</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued not for himſelfe more valour then he gaue them, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was accompanied with a Knight, no leſſe then they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with grace, and Fortitude, who after were knowne to be, the one for Nephewe, and the other being <hi>Don Eleno</hi> Prince of <hi>Dacia,</hi> couzen to the Emperour <hi>Trebatio.</hi> The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were <hi>Archiſilora</hi> Quéene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> and the other <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Callidonia.</hi> Theſe be they braue knight whom the world ſhould iuſtly ſerue, and acknowledge for Soueraignes therof, for their beauties doth deſerue it. You haue highly fauored me faire Lady (ſayd he) telling me ſuch famous Tryumphes as the Greekes haue had, and you ſhal make it compleate binding me to your ſeruice to make mee partaker of your name and Eountrey, I am content (aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Dame) for in all things I deſire to pleaſure you, my name is <hi>Sarmacia</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and through a certaine aduenture in queſt of a Knight I came to <hi>Greece,</hi> which hath not a little contented mee, hauing enioyed the ſight of your valour. With the greateſt ioy in the world dyd <hi>Bembo</hi> riſe, and ſayd.</p>
               <p>Oh Soueraigne Princeſſe, I beſéech you giue mee your Royall handes, for onely to me is this fauor due, as to your
<pb facs="tcp:13977:116"/>
couzen <hi>Bembo</hi> being the Knight that ſtands before you. In her Countrey had the Ladye heard admirable report of that Princes valour, and howe neere of kinne they were, his Mother being her Fathers Siſter. In her ſoule did ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce to bee acquainted with him, ſo ſhe imbraced him vſing many kindneſſe betwene them confirming the Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie among them, with their pleaſaunt couerſation: which was not to ſo ſmall effect, but after it greatlye auayled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the concluding of the geneall peace. In their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hee could not but diſcouer to her his Loues, and loſſe of <hi>Liriana,</hi> which ſo tormented him with repetition thereof, that hee could not but watter them with many teares, more like a tender Louer, then a warlike Knight, whoſe enemies they be. His faire couzen did comfort him with theſe words. Courage braue Knight for onely it muſt ſet your Ladye in your handes, and be not amazed nor wonder at Loues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. For his vnconſuming fier pardons none, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewes it ſelfe moſt furious againſt them that are with leſſe care, onely that it may bee knowen, yf there bee anye plague worſe then other in the world tis ſubiect to his more fiercer torments, and that he is whom ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for ſole Supreame Lord of the vniuerſe. A mallady is yours ſo common, that hauing many to bee companions in it, it may be ſome cauſe to leſſen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paine that particulerly is receaued. And it is not poſſible the place where your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye is inchaunted ſhould be ſo ſecret as not to bee knowne, and being, for what ſhall your valerous arme ſerue but to fetch her forth, though in the enterprize wee looſe our liues, and my ſelfe from this time offer myne to bee imployed in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing you ſhall néede.</p>
               <p>Thats not it (ſwéete couze) that grieues me (replyed the amorous youth) but to haue heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in her houſe &amp; company, a knight was brought vp, whom twas told me ſhe loued as her ſoule &amp; tis ſuſpected this was he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtole her from <hi>Nyquea</hi> though I was there aſſured that hee had alſo loſt her, why
<pb facs="tcp:13977:117"/>
thats an eaſie remedy (ſayd ſhe) by taking away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knights lyfe from betwene you. And if altogether fortune will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute vs with barbarous crueltie, there are other Ladies on whome you may imploy your thoughts, that may be no leſſe beautifull then the Princeſſe of <hi>Nyquea,</hi> though hers be ſo matchleſſe as you ſay, whereto he replyed Onely that doe I feare (excellent Lady,) that loue will bring me to that paſſe, that I ſhall not loue what I doe now. And in faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me to a true louer nothing but this is odious: For he that loueth onely in this procures to propagate his Fame, leauing in hand of inconſtant fortune the remedie from: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> partie loued: who ſeing how ſhee is loued, and for her ſake what is ſuffered, ſhe may beſtow her guerdon not as this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues, but according to the liberall fauors that louers vſe. In this that were theſe amorous Princes, when along the ſame meadowe they ſpyed a Knight comming in rich white armor with many knots of gold and greene about them, on his ſhield in the middle of many flames was ſet a faire Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Straight did ſhe knowe him, and it was not a little ſhe did in not manifeſting her loue, with the ioye ſhe conceaued to ſee her deare <hi>Oriſtides,</hi> who was he that came. At that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe laced on her helme ſaying to <hi>Bembo.</hi> Behold yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deare couzen the whole remaynder of deſtroyed <hi>Troy,</hi> &amp; beleeue me the world hath not a better Knight: I am glad you are in ſuch an occaſion preſent, for I haue a combate to performe againſt him agreede vpon in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> where we had a certaine controuerſie. But that arryued the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Troyan,</hi> verie glad to ſee them ſo well armed, hee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them and ſayd.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me (ſir Knights) any newes of a Knight in Indian colour armour, with ſeauen ſtarrs vpon his ſhield who maks me ſeek him with more care about theſe wods, then I haue reaſon for? The Ladie made anſwere, we haue not ſeene him ſir Knight: but according to the care you ſaye you haue to ſeke him, no maruel if you bee careleſſe of a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle you appointed at <hi>Lacedemon:</hi> for tis an ignominious
<pb facs="tcp:13977:117"/>
wrong you offer to your perſon, not to performe your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, hauing giuen as a pledge of your word &amp; fayth, ſome of your armour. In quiet did not the Louer liue after he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her he had preſent, lamenting her abſence with continuall teares a true token of his alienation, yet coulde not he thinke that his Lady ſhould depart from her Country to ſéeke him. So he replyed. Truely ſir Knight you doe me wronge to charge mee with what I neuer imagined. I am more ſoryer for that (replyed ſhe) then for any other thinge you ſhould haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: For there nothing is more offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to their Fames that hath it like you, then forgetfulnes of that which ſo much concernes them: &amp; becauſe I thinke I ſpeake with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Troyan <hi>Oriſtides,</hi> ſee here his ſword which was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me there y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I might come to ſéek him here, &amp; make you know it had been better you had ſhewed your ſelfe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in returning thither, then to wander through theſe wods in ſearch of other Knights. Shee ſpake it ſo high that hee preſently knewe it was ſhe his hart had chooſen for his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne. He leapt from his horſe with more Maieſty then <hi>Mars</hi> could, and ſayd. So euill entreated did I remaine of that battle (ſir Knight) that I haue no ſtrength to ende it now: ſo is it my ſureſt way to render the glorie of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to your all-conquering hand. Then he put off his helme ſhewing his faire face, and holding the ſword by the poynte he knéeled before the Lady. Shee could not ſuffer it, for ſhe loued him as her life. Shee alſo put of hers reſting more faire then <hi>Apollo,</hi> and with that loue, as louers receaue the loued obiect, ſhee imbraced him ſaying. Seeing your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe braue <hi>Oriſtides,</hi> twas not much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ventured my life to ſeeke you. He anſwered. Deeds are theſe (moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princeſſe) nothing differing from your magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie: and I intreate you if anye offence your beauty hath receaued on my behalfe, which cannot be little, you wil with your owne hand take your reuenge, then replyed the Ladie. There is no ſuch offence (gallant Lord) but thinking I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned indebted for your comming to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> onely to
<pb facs="tcp:13977:118"/>
combate with me. I thought to require it by coming to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> not with warre, but to craue peace of the Knight that vanquiſht me. I am, and euer will be yours vanquiſhed (ſaid the <hi>Troyan</hi>) moſte beauteous Ladie as one that onlye winnes therein. Leaue this (replied the amorous Ladie) &amp; ſpeake to the Prince of <hi>Achaya</hi> that is this Knight which comes with me, who is not a little affected to you: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Troian</hi> ſpake. All the worlde deare Ladie knowing how dearely I loue you, is bound to doe me fauour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they receaued one another as befitted their Royalties. In their that he vnderſtood he was Couſin to his Ladie, for with no ſmalle alteration was he till then ſuppoſing he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her: well did the haughtie <hi>Moore</hi> perceaue the affection that his Couſin bare to that Knight (this paſſion can neuer be incloſed where tis well rooted.) It came to be ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that <hi>Bembo</hi> would winne the gallant <hi>Oriſtides</hi> by mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits aſſuring his glorie, betrothing them there in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to all their high contents. The two warriors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted perpetuall ametie, which in particuler they ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued, for in generall in the Greeke warres, <hi>Oriſtides</hi> could not forſake the great <hi>Trebatio</hi> hauing receaued ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many fauours at his handes. The newe betrothed louers intreated the Prince of <hi>Achaya</hi> to goe and bee acquainted with the Gréeke Emperour, but as hee liued in continuall woes he could not condiſcend to their intreaties, anſwering there would not want occaſion to doe it another time, hee tooke his leaue of them to all their griefes. And mounting on his fierie Courſer hee ſpurd through the thickeſt of the Forreſt till he came to the Sea coaſt, where hee ſhipt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not directing his iourney to any certaine place more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where fortune and the waues would conduct him. The two louers deſirous to ſee themſelues alone, paſt all the day in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Forreſt, which they thought but a minute, where if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yan</hi> were couragious hee would not defer the end of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous deſires. It was not knowen for the trées kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but her time being expyred, the Lady was deliuered
<pb facs="tcp:13977:118"/>
of a Daughter whoſe beauty was imcomparable.</p>
               <p>They named her <hi>Polixena</hi> at the <hi>Troyans</hi> requeſt deſirous to leaue ſome memorie of his antient ſtocke. Leſſe diſcords then the firſt did not this cauſe, as the Fourth part doth recorde, for a Gréeke did loue her to the death. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> where the Emperour receaued them with great ioy eſtéeming the <hi>Troyan</hi> as one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and knowing they were betrothed hee gaue them the Tytle, and Crowned him Kinge of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> an Acte that through the world was applauded with high prayſes. All the Lordes and Ladies celebrated his Coronation, &amp; Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualles, with ſtately ſhewes and reuealings. And the time of her deliuerie being come, ſhe and <hi>Roſamond</hi> were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both in one day, <hi>Sarmacias</hi> being publique, but the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>Roſamond</hi> was deliuered in the handes of <hi>Archiſilora</hi> (to whome ſhe diſcloſed this ſecret) of a Boy the faireſt that his age did knowe. Both Ladies gaue his name according to his beautie: he was borne with a moſt bright Starre in the middle of his breſt, they called him <hi>Roſelindo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little they enioyed him, for through the wall there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred a graue wiſe man that toulde them that the life of the Child conſiſted to be deliuered in his handes: the Mother would by no meanes doe it. But the Quéene would, and ſo perſwaded her to it. They charged the wiſe man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in all thinges belonging to a good Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>This traytor <hi>Lupercio</hi> promiſed but did not accompliſh it, and rather conuayed him to the Kingdomes of <hi>Pruſia</hi> farr remoted from Gréece, where hee was brought vp with the Kinges Daughter, ſhee from that time louing him as her life. It ſhall be hereafter declared, for <hi>Lyrgandeo</hi> is nothing briefe in deſcribing the actes of this haughtie Prince equall in valour to all his kindered, and a horſe-backe he exceld them, for a better Gennet neuer did the world containe, where we muſt leaue theſe on the land, returning to <hi>Bembo</hi> on the Seas.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith ſome conſolation did the Heroyck <hi>Bem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaya</hi> depart from his deare cozen <hi>Sarmacia</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> thinking he wronged his hawghty corage, not to ſhew the magnanimitie of his mind againſt the rigorous cauſes of blinde For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: with this deſire he entred the firſt barke he found on the Sea ſhore, deſirous a while to Nauigate by ſea, ſeeyng how he languiſhed on land. The Maiſter and all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, receaued him with great content iudging him of high accompt, and deſeruer of farre more courteſie. He put of his helme, diſcouering his faire and ſturdy viſage, which more aſtoniſht them binding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more vnto more kindneſſe. His haires were of a darke yellow color verie thick curled, a manifeſt token of his approoued ſtrength. His colour was white: and his face full fleſht &amp; well proportioned: his eies ſéemed cherefull, but being inraged, they amazed the looker on with trembling feare, he was double breſted, inſomuch that no armour except purpoſely made woulde fit him, hee was an enemie to effeminate men. Neuer did fighting wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, nor neuer began battle, but aſſuredly thought the Iuſtice on his ſide. Being Conquerour, hee would more plainely ſhewe the generoſitie of his minde, attracting the wills of the conquered with ſinguler clemencie, ſaying, that ſo rare a vertue ought not to be extinguiſhed by the honour of a bloody victory, and ſo would take the conqueſt on hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as the conquered. Finally <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> ſayth that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceping his Competitors, the world had not a better Prince: his loues diſtracted him of his beſt ſences, for imagining
<pb facs="tcp:13977:119"/>
that another loued his Lady and was of her beloued, he loſt the raignes of patience, with ſighes publiſhing what his ſoule indured, vrged thereto by the aboundance of his ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hart, as nowe hee did with in the ſhippe he went. For the fourth day of his Nauigation, ſeeing himſelfe more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed in his imaginarie thoughts then in the waters whoſe furious billowes his barke plowed, hee roſe about midnight, ſitting on the hatches, to eaſe his moanes, hee ſighed forth, theſe looſe rymes.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:120"/>There wanted no louing ſighes wherewith the valyant youth bemoaned his paines, and the glorie that from them he conceaued, calling the Sea Gods and Goddeſſes to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes his paſſions, who hearing what the gentle Louer pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, could not but pittie him. So paſt he the night till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the bright lacing of the high heauens, he ſawe a barke more ſwifter then the winde paſſe by his, along thereon lay a Knight all armed, no leſſe lamenting his griefes then he, and yet with more reaſon, he went ſaying.</p>
               <p>Oh loue, may it bee thou ſhouldſt by all meanes ſeeke to ruinate my onely hopes being ſo long ſince aſſured, that if I liue tis but to loue, yeilding to thée the awefull tribute of my tributarie ſelfe as liedge man to thy deitie, and that for all theſe ſpoyles, hauing my hart as hoſtage of my faith thou ſhouldſt delight to permit the enemie of my death to vſe mee thus, giuing me life to liue in ſuch diſtreſſe? No more could the amorous <hi>Pagan</hi> heare, by reaſon of the celeritie it carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though by it he vnderſtoode the wrong he ſuffered, and ſeing howe generall it was, ſayde. Oh woefull Prince, what little remedie is there left thée, ſeeing tis denyed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one, there is no hoping for it by liuing? Oh peſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous plague, how much art thou wrapt within the poyſon of thy torments, and yet how wiſhed is it to the dire coſt of louers poore ſoules, that with ſuch bitter lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts doe celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te their ſwéete woes. By this did he ſée that the bark was ſtayed not farre from the foot of a ſtately edefice, builded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſea. The <hi>Achayan</hi> Lord reſted amazed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſight: and to knowe what it was commanded his to bee dirrected thither: he entred by the ſide of the inſcriptions, in ſight of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight, that was already ryzen, reſembling <hi>Mars</hi> himſelfe, by his magnificence: with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ſcrowle that <hi>Bembo</hi> mett with, was this.</p>
               <q>The entrance of the marueilous Tower is granted to none, not bringing the armor of the ingrateſt Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of the earth.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:120"/>Naturally bould was the furious youth, and not reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the contents of the ſcrowle, hee flunge at one of the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, thinking that way was the aſcending to the Tower. But he had ſcarce taken it with his handes, when ſodainely there aroſe ſo much fier that the Knight ſeemed all of a kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled coale, and certainely he had incurred mightie daunger of his life, had he not had on the armes of <hi>Saturne</hi> whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſiſted that element. Notwithſtanding he parted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, almoſt ſtifled with the heate that entred through his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. Well did the other Knight ſée it that not farre from thence, gazed on thoſe that looked towardes the occident, &amp; ſeeing the fier that had riſen, (though more ready he ſeemed for his graue, then to ſmile) yet he laughed ſo high that the fierce <hi>Pagan</hi> heard it, that not a little was abaſhed thereat, and not able to diſſemble it, ſayd. I would gladly knowe (ſir Knight) the cauſe of your content, ſince with ſuch exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior ſignes you haue ſhewen it. None other (replyed hee in the yellowe of this colour was his armour,) but to haue ſéene (ſir Knight) with what vehemencie that flame would haue imbraſt you within your armour. It cannot bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt what rage entred within the <hi>Pagan,</hi> by the aunſwere, he turned to the diſpayrer, ſaying. It had been farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince you haue ſéene armour to haue tryed the ſauor of the fier of the pillers, in that the ſcorching flames of Loue, you haue already publiſhed along the ſea in your Nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and now I dare affirme you are with reaſon thus ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred to liue, conſidering how much you flie from labour.</p>
               <p>Wiſe and aduiſed is the Ladye, that from ſo cowarde a Knight detaines her fauors: But ſince you haue ſéene with what audacitie I embrace yonder fier, prepare your ſelfe, for to your coſt will I make you know, how I can defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incloſed in my hart. There was no need to aduiſe him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Mars</hi> would he haue fought touching what <hi>Bembo</hi> there had vrged.

<pb facs="tcp:13977:121"/>
and <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> and the diſpayrer was no leſſe then the Greeke Prince <hi>Claridiano,</hi> who out of hope in loue, as <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> hath related departed from <hi>Grecia.</hi> None of the waterie Gods woulde looſe ſuch a battle, for neyther <hi>Faune</hi> nor <hi>Nymphe</hi> but came to behold it: And not ſo much but the amorous <hi>Trytones</hi> lifted vp their heads to looke on the twoo ſole rare in the world. In ſight did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> angry ſwelling waues neuer ſéeme more milde then nowe. Peace did <hi>Eolus</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> make together with all their ſeuerall attending traynes raynging along the gréene azured waters till they came to the place where the battle was to be fought. The gentle <hi>Dolphins</hi> Friendes to Humane kinde with ſportiue leapes began to ſolemnize the fight. In the aire appeared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty God of battailes, in the ſame forme that he became <hi>Venus</hi> Champion to approoue her fayreſt. The windowes of the wonderous Tower were opened at the which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the incloſed Ladies, whoſe preſence beautified the deepe, and made the loftie heauens farre more faire. All the Ladies, &amp; ſea Goddeſſes with <hi>Marſes</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent ordained Iudge of the fight, the moſt beauteous <hi>Lyriana,</hi> that fayrer them the cauſer of the <hi>Grecian</hi> diſcordes, appeared all in white. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one aboue &amp; beneath made her a ſolemne courſie. <hi>Mars</hi> deſcending lowe with his Celeſtiall throne inuited her into his ſeate. The gallant dame would not admit it, but rather ſet her breſts, (chiefe purities of chiefeſt purenes) to leane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the windowes, at what time, the inraged <hi>Pagan</hi> turned his eyes and ſaw her whoſe Image in his ſoule was ſtampt. He was amazed with the new ſight. Euery thinge ſlipt out of his memorie, and with the greateſt forgetfulneſſe of the world, he caſt himſelfe vpon the pummell of his ſword, and looſing the raygnes of all his imaginations, he ſo occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed himſelfe in the good he viewed, that he thought there was no more to be hoped, ioying to haue founde where ſhe was inchaunted, that ſo had inchaunted his deſires.</p>
               <p>There was neuer ſéene a more quicker diſtraction then that. Wherein <hi>Bembo</hi> was onely gazing on the excellencie
<pb facs="tcp:13977:121"/>
of his Lady. Well did <hi>Claridiano</hi> note the <hi>Mores</hi> amaze, but thinking he did it, in little eſtéeming him, he leant into his ſhippe; and therefore was the battle more fiercer, and ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to him, ſhaking him by the arme, ſayd.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ſéeme (Knight) you haue forgot the proud words you gaue me, ſeing how careleſly you ſtande looking on La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. As one wakened out of a ſwéet dreame returned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> vnto himſelfe, replying. I was not ſo forgetfull of thy diſcourteſie, but I haue it well in remembrance, &amp; glad that none is here to diſturbe me from reuenging it. That was no time of ceremonious courteſies, for ere hee ended his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, our new baptized Knight had aſſaulted the <hi>Pagan</hi> with more puiſſance then he that beheld him. Vppon his rich helme hee gaue him ſuch a blowe, that it made him ſet one hande vpon the grounde. This was the greateſt blowe the <hi>Pagan</hi> did receaue ſince he put on armour. Before he roſe he had giuen him another on his Beuer, that ſquadrons of ſparkles flew about his head. Abaſhed was the <hi>Moore</hi> at ſuch mighty ſtroakes; vnable to imagine whom ſo ſtrong a Knight might hee; but altogether beeing recouered to the toppe of the Gréekes ſhéelde he let flie a pitty leſſe blow, which made him giue backe with twoo or thrée vnſeemely ſtepps.</p>
               <p>To helpe him downewardes did he enter with one, and another thruſt with the vtmoſt ſtrength of his arme: either of them had ſtuck him, but his ſure armour rebounded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe, notwithſtanding they put him to great paine. The <hi>Pagan</hi> followed with vehemence thinking to ouerthrowe him: but <hi>Archiſiloras</hi> Louer that perceaued it, houlding his owne ſwoord hard, turning away let him goe by him, and as he paſt, on the toppe of his plumed helme did <hi>Claridiano</hi> diſcharge the furie of his ſtrength, that he made his mouth a conduit of his luke-warme blood. Ere he recouered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he gaue him on that ſide a furious thruſt, it was well for the <hi>Pagan</hi> to giue backe at the ſtrength thereof, yet it happened betwixt a ioynt, cutting his fleſh, &amp; leauing him
<pb facs="tcp:13977:122"/>
ſore wounded. The warmeſt blood within the <hi>Pagan</hi> fréezed to ſee it on his aduerſaries blade, his ſhield he caſt at his backe, and with both handes at <hi>Claridianos</hi> hee let flye, it yeildes him no defence, for from the one to the other end it was diuided, and it was a miracle he did not the like by his arme, with the ſwords point he deſcended, cutting a great peece of his ſkirt, alſo falling on his Cuſhes which being pierſt it wounded him a little on the thigh. They that were borne to bee feared, feared not each other, but ſetting their left féete forwards, and ſwoords in both hands, began to change their practiſe to that vſed among the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> in Vulcans <hi>Aetnean</hi> worke-houſe: the ſeas reſounded with the furious noiſe of their battaile. The heauens racking clouds were driuen with amazement from their ſtandings, poſting one through the other at the ſight thereof. So did they that gazed thereon, ſometimes ducking their heades vnder the water becauſe they would not ſee the remorceleſſe blowes of ſo pittileſſe a combate. Three howres haue they ſought, yet no aduantage could be decerned: they were ſo tired, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one ſelfe will they w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drew apart to breath. It was worſe for the <hi>Moore,</hi> becauſe the Barke being narrow he had no roome to walk, and ſo the wound in his ſide being great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan exceedingly to grieue him. In a thouſand imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was he in, calling himſelfe coward, that in preſence of his Ladie one ſole Knight ſhould put him in that ſtate. In faith with reaſon (ſaid the <hi>Pagan</hi>) may the world blame me, ſince ſo little courage I doe ſhew, where, from whence I ought to drawe it out of weakenes: what iuſtice canne I haue to craue redreſſe, and remedie for my paine, putting the firſt battaile in my Goddeſſe preſence on ſuch a danger? how may I be truſted with any rendring ſo ill an accompt of this? next to this a thowſand blaſphemies breathed the <hi>Moore</hi> againſt his Gods, whoſe furie with ſuch deuotion he had procured: but ſéeing it is come to this (continued he) I will reuerence yee as your careleſneſſe deſerues.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Claridiano</hi> inſenced with yre, vttered many things
<pb facs="tcp:13977:122"/>
againſt himſelfe being by one Knight ſo bayted. Iniuſtly (ſaid the furious <hi>Greeke</hi>) may I be called the ſonne of ſuch a Father: for he had by this ended twoo ſuch Combates, but I that am his Sonne, haue hazarded the loſſe of one that is preſented to me.

                  </hi> for he that tributaried his hart to her in the woods of <hi>Greece,</hi> had before this obtained a glorious victorie. His furie ſo encreaſed, that he tooke his ſwoord twixt both his handes, and made towardes the <hi>Pagan,</hi> that more couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than a Lyon ſtayed for him? Together they met, and with ſuch blowes regreeted each other, that <hi>Mars</hi> in his ſupreame throane did tremble. One knée to the ground did the <hi>Greeke</hi> ſet, but the <hi>Pagan</hi> his right hand, he aroſe as ſwift as a towring Faulcon: and croſſing his ſwoord with the <hi>Greekes,</hi> entring on a ſudden with his left foote, with more celeritie then the quicke minde he let ſlie at his legs. It was a wonder he did not vnlace them, but it ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with payne the one of them, that hee could not ſturre it, and <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> ſayth the ſmart thereof laſted all the while the fight indured.</p>
               <p>Well did the <hi>More</hi> ſée the good blowe hee hadd made and therefore would he cloſe with him, and the Gréeke could not refuſe it, being taken with ſome aduantage, he was almoſt ouerthrowne, ſo fiercely hee entred to the wraſtle: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of one foote two, he ſtoode ſo ſtrongly, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> thought he hadde incompaſſed a Rocke. So longe they ſtryued that they fell on the hatches, not daring to looſen, fearing to looſe thereby. By this meanes did the <hi>Achay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> looſe ſo much blood that it was maruell how he could hold out, for all the barke was ſtayned with the hewe, tumbling vppe and downe the boate, the Gréeke went ſo nighe the boorde thereof, that taking houlde thereat with more ſtrength then maye bee imagined, in deſpight of the <hi>Moore</hi> with a ſwinge hee flung him to the farther ſyde, &amp; with admirable lightnes he ſet himſelfe on foot. Slow was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Pagan</hi> in doing the like, though in this ſeconde battle
<pb facs="tcp:13977:123"/>
was plainely ſéene what aduantage the yellow Knight had ouer his aduerſarie, and the Combate continuing to the end, the <hi>More</hi> could not but be ouercome. The Ladie would not ſuffer it, for only to that intent had ſhe her perfect iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by meanes of the peruerſe <hi>Lupercio:</hi> ſo ſhee ſpake, heere me ſir Knights? Hearing the Ladies voice, neither ſtirred their ſwoords, for the gallantneſſe wherewith both were adorned, bound them to it: ſhee procéeded. May this teſtimonie (braue Knights) ſuffice which you haue giuen to the déepe ſeas, that for my ſake making no longer battle, yée leaue it in this eſtate. They could not do otherwiſe then the Ladie intreated: it benefited the <hi>Moore</hi> therein, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. So long hath my will obayed the ſupreame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund of yours moſt Excellent Ladie, that I cannot do more then what is your content: and ſeing herein you doe receaue it, I am content, ſo pleaſeth this Knight.

To doe ſo you haue it ſir Knight anſwered the Ladie. He tooke his farewell of her and the <hi>Pagan;</hi> leauing with him ynough to talke of his valour many yeares after.

In that viſion wold he haue dyed, thinking he departed in quiet: but hauing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-paſt that amorous care, with a ſigh, he burſt into theſe ſpéeches.</p>
               <p>Oh cruell Lady, ſcourge of the <hi>Achayan</hi> houſe, may it be ſuch inhumane crueltie ſhould bee incloſed within ſo faire a Lady? what law permits thou ſhouldſt knowe I dye, I ioye therein, that tis my life to ſuffer many deathes for thy ſake, and that thou haſt neuer been pleaſed to ſay I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to admit it?

If then (faireſt of all Fayres, beauteous <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>) thou art of this aſſured, why doeſt thou thus prolong my remedie? why becomeſt thou deaffe to my exclaymes?

Firſt began I to pyne, ere I knewe whome I loued, &amp; ſince from all aſpects I am diſſwaded, (and ſhoulde belieue it) will I onely in thoughts end my dayes. So much blood loſt he, that the Maiſter pittying him ſayd. Sir Knight bee not ſuch an enemy to your ſelfe, for it may coſt you your life, the differring of your cure. My happe will not bée ſo good
<pb facs="tcp:13977:124"/>
(replyed the Prince) as to meete with death for it, doth my paine expect and deſire anchorage of the griefe it ſuſtaines. Neuertheleſſe (ſayd the Maiſter) tis a kinde of diſpaire to ſuffer a death by the heauens vnappointed, for tis a blemiſh to any ones honour. Such perſwaſions he vſed, that he put of his armor, and layde him on a bed within the Mayſters cabbin. They dreſt him with greate care, yet greater was his of his Lady. They would not ſuffer him to riſe in foure daies which he continued the thinking to ſée his Goddeſſe, &amp; ſeing twas but in vaine, he commanded to direct to <hi>Achaya</hi> intending to demaund of his friend <hi>Lupercio</hi> what armour &amp; weapons the entrance to that Tower required. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to pleaſe him would haue done it, but there aroſe a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine tempeſt, that twas vnpoſſible to arryue there, ſo were they carryed backwards vp &amp; downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecian <hi>Ocean,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the eyght day they arriued in a moſt aboundant land full of many trées and woods. It gladded the Prince, for the Sea had tyred him. So he commanded his furious Courſer to be landed, and armed in all his armor, he leapt on ſhore, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the reſt to ſtaye for him eyght dayes, while hee learned what countrey that was. He tooke the moſt vſedſt path he could ſée till the after-noone that the Sunnes myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day heate was ſomewhat coole, he alighted to reſt cloſe to a Fountaine, eating ſuch prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as his pages had brought from the ſhip. So eating was the <hi>Pagan</hi> there, but his pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim thoughts wandred on <hi>Lyriana,</hi> when to the ſame foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine where he was, arryued a damozell no leſſe beauteous then well attired, who not (for all the Prince was there) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with rare gallantnes, to refreſh her faire face in the pearled ſpring, where ſhe reaſſured her ſelfe ſhee was beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, hauing dried her face with a ſemely wantonneſſe, ſhe ſtept to the Prince with theſe words. Sir Knight, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heate, and the commodiouſnes of the place haue forced me to beare you company, although reſpecting the ſorrow your armour doth expreſſe, I belieue it will diſcontent you, delighting in
<pb facs="tcp:13977:124"/>
ſolitude, a meanes that loue hath inuented to louers coſtes to eaſe their paines and incorage their penſiueneſſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous was the <hi>Pagan,</hi> and vſed to ſaye hee merited not the to bee named a Knight that woulde not in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies behalfe aduenture his life, hazarding his owne affaires to doe them ſeruice: and ſo anſwered.</p>

               <p>It well ſéemes (ſir Knight) you bee in loue, ſeeing with your reaſons you woulde ſo ſoone launche into the déepe of beautye, a common thinge amonge Knightes that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue for the preſent, &amp; there is no cauſe you ſhould aſſure mee of my beautye, for with it the Fountaine reſtes more gladded, then that wherein <hi>Narciſſus</hi> gazed: So that Sir Knight you muſt ſéeke other meanes then theſe to Court the Dames of <hi>Trebizound</hi> (which is the Lande you nowe are in) for this here is too common, and they knowe it verye well that preſume ſo on their beautyes, for tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them of it, is to increaſe their rygor againſt them that in this land ſo wooe.</p>

They doe ſo that will not beléeue what they are, contrary to vs in <hi>Trebizound,</hi> and therefore be they pleaſed to be tearmed by what they are not, giuing their louers fauors though faygned for it: who more by inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating then a firme faith procure the content of beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. Not for all the Ladies ſo ſaying to their gallantes, (ſweete damozell anſwered the <hi>Pagan.</hi>) Ceaſe they to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, carefull, and for their Miſtres good moſt ready. The damozell replyed, with that, tis ſo: for it doth more euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew how the hart loues: and on the laſt, grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding what abroade is vſed, I ſaye, that Ladye is ingratefull that will not ſhew her pittie being aſſured ſhee may, by a Thouſande new fauors that her gallant may be animated, knowing if he liues by louing that his fayth is alſo repayd by loue.

               <p>In reſpect of the intollerable paines ſuffered, do they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer require any guerdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only procure to propagate that magnanimitie wherwith they ſacrifize the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto their Ladies, ſetting in their hands their hearts &amp; ſoules, expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing hereby but the glorious ſirname of their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous knights.

In this and in a thouſand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots which Loue propounded him was he occupied, when from out a fragant thicket he ſaw comming a companie of Knights richly armed: not farre after them there came three attending on a ſumptuous Carre, wherein he thought hee ſawe ſome Ladies, till approching more nigh, he was aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it was ſo ouer-viewing the riches of the knights: Two of them were of one deuiſe, all gréen with the ſpaniſh armes vpon their ſhields, wherby he knew them to be Spaniards, as indeed they were, being thoſe two valiant brothers that went to the Grecian warres, for the Emperoure <hi>Alphebo</hi> would not ſuffer them to retourne accoumpting greatly of them, ſo they were entertayened with name and Charge of Captaines of the Empyre. The other (that ſéemed of a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conſtitution although ſo well proportioned, that the Prince highly reputed him) was that warlike and gallant <hi>Teferreo,</hi> great friend to the Emperour and <hi>Don Eleno:</hi> his armour was ruſſet ſet with many riche ſtones, which with curious knots wonderfully adorned his ſtrong breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate. Neuer did the Prince ſee ſo bigge &amp; comely a knight, and though he himſelfe was not much leſſe than ix. féete in height, yet with his hand could he not reach the others head.

would not, he was knowen. The Ladies being verie yonge entertained hys deuiſe with ſome ſmiles, which made the Engliſh Lady thus ſay, I am beſides my ſelfe when I conſider what power a Ladies diſfauoure hath ouer any Knight, for preſentlye as if they were ſlaine, they bewaile in mourning the life they liue, iudging it tenne times worſe then death. It is common among Knights (anſwered <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiluera</hi>) to expreſſe the paine of the ſoule, cauſed by the ſight of the ordreſſe. And belieue me not if our kéepers bee not like to incurre ſome diſgrace with him in the blacke, for he ſeemes valiant. Where <hi>Teferreo</hi> is (ſaid <hi>Artemiſa</hi>) there is no reaſon to feare that. Neuertheleſſe (anſwered the Princeſſe) ſhall you ſee I ſpeake true.

               <p>The Knightes ſent to the <hi>Pagan</hi> a Page with this meſſage. Sir Knight. In yonder Charriot rydes the Princeſſe of <hi>Trebizound <hi>Roſiluera,</hi>
                  </hi> and to woorke her content, the three Knightes are determined to demaunde the Iuſtes of al they ſhall méete by the waye, and thinking vnder ſuch deuiſe there cannot want any loue, they ſende me to intreate you, that in ſeruice of yonder Ladye you would Iuſte with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, and your guerdon (yf you vanquiſh) ſhalbe the greateſt that can be, for you muſt accompany them as their keeper, defending them gainſt all aduentures that ſhall happen: and they themſelues to looſe what the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to fauour them had graunted. This demande glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the furious youth, and ſo replyed.</p>
               <p>Good page I had rather in any other thing then by Iuſtes ſerue thoſe Ladies, for alwaies by them redounds perpetual enmitie. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nding if therew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be pleaſed, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous &amp; rude were I to diſobay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo tell thoſe knights I am content to doe it, but that I will admitte no more
<pb facs="tcp:13977:127"/>
then the Iuſts. With this anſwer returned the Page vnto the Ladies, which greatly pleaſed them to ſee him ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: for the Iuſts the chollerick Spanyard prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but here got he little, for <hi>Lirianas</hi> louer encountred him ſo ſtrongly, that he threw him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſaddle, he loſt one ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop but he recouered it ſo quicke that none perceaued it. To reuenge his brother prickt forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> elder, finding like gaine, although this encounter was ſtronger, yet not to lette him from paſſing forwards on his ſwift Courſer, vntill the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Charriot, who to enioy better of his ſight had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to be opened on all ſides: he had not ſéene out of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> greater nor rarer beautie then there was. Some altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his breſt did it cauſe, remedies are they, that though they doe not altogether ſalue, yet diſpoſe of cure for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of his blindneſſe, placing his loue, where hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe was méere deſpaire. To gaze on them he ſtood ſtill, to whome <hi>Roſiluera</hi> ſaid: we knowe not wherein we haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you ſir Knight, that with ſuch crueltie you ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue vs of our kéepers: he replied. Moſt excellent Ladies, as I was requeſted be them to doe it, I preſumed ſo to doe your pleaſure: ſince that, haue matters happened ſo to my Honor, that I know not wherto I ſhould attribute it, ſaue that Fortune alredie wearie in perſecuting me, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſhew ſome fauour. Neuertheleſſe if I haue diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I am readie to make ſatisfaction, rendring the victorie vnto theſe knights, and leaue the Iuſts with him that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects me. So let he his launce fall to the ground, wee will not accept this excuſe (ſaid the Princeſſe) but wil haue you follow the auſpiouſneſſe of your fortune. Not I faire Ladie (anſwered he) except your beautie do commaund me: ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth we are pleaſed therby (replied <hi>Artemiſa</hi>) that you may feareleſſe doe it ſir knight, and as for the other that doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine againſt your winning of the thrée knights place, to aduenture my life for it is nothing (anſwered the gallant lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:) and therfore will I trie whether my Fortune be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged or no. He humbled himſelfe to them with ſuch gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:127"/>
that both Ladies wiſht him victorie, hee tooke vp his launce himſelfe, more quicker then a birde returning to his Carrier. To the Iuſte ſpurd the couragious Gyant, with more horror then a flaſhe of Lightning renteth through the Clowdes vaniſhing in them. The ſhieuers of their Laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mounted ſo high that they were neuer more ſéene: Fiue launces did they breake without knowen loſſe. Abaſhed was <hi>Teferreo</hi> thereat, ſeing his hap before the Princeſſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayd. Sir Knight if you thinke good lets end the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at all aduentures, ſeeing wee cannot bee vnhorſt. The Prince feared to diſpleaſe the Ladies, ſo made this anſwere. I would (ſir Knight) gladly content you herein, but that I come with ſuch haſt, that I may not ſtay ſo long but I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, to be performed this day foure moneths in <hi>Achaya.</hi> It pleaſeth me (replyed the Gyant) and bearing this deuiſe you ſhall not now néede to tell your name. With ſuch cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie (replyed he) doth fortune perſecute mee, that I intend all my life to weare this empreze, ſo whereſoeuer you ſhal ſéeke me, demaunding in <hi>Achaya</hi> for the vnfortunate knight ſhall you heare newes of me. They turned their horſes with more furie then <hi>Mars</hi> hadde done, and with an vnthought ſpéede they met with ſuch force that all the Forreſt ecchoed. Out of the ſaddle did <hi>Teferreo</hi> finde himſelfe, newes to him ſince <hi>Don Elenos</hi> battaile, yet was his fall good by carrying his raygnes in his hande, though the Horſe helpt him little for eleuating himſelfe made him that hee could not recouer his ſeate. The valerous <hi>Bembo</hi> that ſtronger bare his legs, remayned on horſebacke, but with ſuch diſorder, without brydle and ſtirropps, that to ſhunne ſome diſgrace, hee was fayne to leape from his Courſer. Courteous was the gyant, ſo he ſayd.</p>
               <p>Yours is the prize of the Iuſtes ſir Knight, hauing wyth ſuch honour obtayned it, ſo may you take our place in guard of the Princeſſe, whoſe aduantage in not ſmall by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. None in kindneſſe went beyond <hi>Bembo,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made this reply. Moſt <hi>Heroyke</hi> Knight, the Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb facs="tcp:13977:128"/>
that through my meanes you looſe the merits deſerued by your perſon, and worthy to theſe Knights, for if I muſt attend on the Ladies it ſhalbee as your friend in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, or otherwiſe I will returne the way I came. Wee will not haue you (ſayd one of the Spanyards) to vanquiſh vs in all thinges, and ſince the condition was ours, there is no cauſe why we ſhould not ſuffer it, and ſo lets ſpeake to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies for tis time they were going. Be it as you wil haue it ſir Knight anſwered <hi>Bembo,</hi> ſeing I muſt not diobay. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready approched the Charriote with the Princeſſes, who in reſpect of the Knights ſéemed ſorrowfull, though the beaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Roſiluera</hi> was the ioyfulleſt in the world, ſeing how wel the Knight in the blacke had defended himſelfe, ſo ſhe ſpake. I beléeue (Knights) we muſt impute to our ſmall merits, and leſſe good fortune, the cauſe of our changing new guard, which being ſo, henceforth (ſir Knight) begin to execute your new charge which I feare you will thinke painefull, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring better lucke now then our kéepers had before. Abaſhed were the vanquiſhed with <hi>Roſilueras</hi> words who accompted him in the blacke the ſole owner of her hart, who made her this reply. I doe rather remaine ſo fearefull of my Croſſe fortune (moſt excellent Princeſſe) that ſeeing howe aduerſe ſhe hath ſtill ſhewen her ſelfe, will now with newe paynes diſcharge her ſelfe of this my preſent (ſo I feare momentary) good, which laſt, if it be equall to the former, no hart is able to indure the griefe, though mine hath had the power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it ſelfe to be yours vntill the lateſt minute.</p>
               <p>O God, how great was the ioy the Lady receaued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anſwere thinking (tis common amongſt them that loue) he vttered it with the firmeneſſe of his ſoules truth, and not as words, of courſe, tending on the ceremonious dutie that her kindnes bound him too. They toke their way to the purling of a clere bubling brooke that ſprung ſomewhat more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the thicket, minding there to paſſe the heate of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, where the Princeſſe ſéemed the ioyfulleſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, ſeeing him goe cloſe to her ſtirrop whom ſhee had pictured in
<pb facs="tcp:13977:128"/>
her hart, whoſe ſilence ſhe thus brake. How fare you Sir Knight with your new office, I am in doubt, it makes you already repent, to haue it vndertaken? Twere ſo (moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lady) replyed the gallant <hi>Achayan.</hi> Did I not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſupremacie of the high glorie wherin my thoughts haue placed me combinde thereto, ſtopping al paſſage to my imagination of hoping other happines, looſing the preſent I do enioy. Hereupon (the beauteous <hi>Artemiſa</hi> tooke occaſion thus.) We would not (ſir Knight) you ſhold ſo ſoone haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgd it, onely paſſing with the imagined glory of the Princeſſe commaund: he made anſwere. As my hart (beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lady) hath alwaies byn full of continuall miſeries &amp; torments, now feling it ſelfe diſcharged of his heauy oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing loade, it ſtraight iudged that fortune prepared, greater paines yeilding mee this preſent extenuation, in middeſt of which thought, to expell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſe from reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance made me breake into that paſſion, I call it ſo, for though I ſéeme (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not continuall) as ſuch a one but litle to féele it, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with ſuch rudeneſſe, how ſhould I doe were it perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: but oh inconſtant chance, why name I a perpetuitie, when I know this good more then felicity, is but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prologue to an vnterminate end of greater paines, by bringing me to the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhing of your commaund whoſe greatnes excéeds all worth of happines co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared? here <hi>Artemiſa</hi> replyed. Why (ſir Knight) we required not to know more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the princeſſe demanded, for whoſoeuer doth guard our chariot, muſt haue his hart ſo exempt of imaginary thoughts, that his care may be only buſied on the preſent obiect of his eie: with theſe and ſuch like ſpéeches they arriued to the fount where the ladies deſcended, ioying to refreſh their heated beauties in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the water, or to ſpeake more aptly to purifie it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their preſence. The like did the foure Princes, the <hi>Achayan</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering his louely countenance. Newe amorous launces to pierce the tender breſt of the all wounded Lady, though (not knowing who he was) ſhe would not diſcloſe it to any, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling rather to ſuffer &amp; liue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honor (but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> paine)
<pb facs="tcp:13977:129"/>
then to blemiſh it by other meanes, yet the eyes wherewith ſhe gazed on him with ſuch particuler care, were euident y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of her affection had the Prince noted it. Together hand in hand the two Ladies walked into the thicket alone, to enioy the freſhnes of the aire, which was ſo pleaſant that it made them go further then they would, and being thicke, &amp; without pathes, they could not when they would returne which not a little grieued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherupon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe ſaid. What ſhall become of vs Lady, if we ſhold remaine in this remoted place? great hath béen our careleſſenes to part ſo far without the companie of our Knights, for we might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily miſcarrie if any wilde beaſt ſhould yſſue out of theſe woods. I maye goe ſecure (replyed <hi>Artemiſa</hi>) for ſeeing you I ſhal be left, to repaire vnto the fayreſt. Hay me (ſayd ſhe) I pray thee ſaye not ſo, for my fleſh trembles to heare it. In theſe Feminine feares were they buſied, when fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wood there came a mighty bigge Knight in bignes, like a gyant, all in armor, with foure Knights with him, of no leſſe force then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maiſter, who was Lord of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous Iſle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> ſituate in the <hi>Carpatian</hi> Sea, not far diſioynd from the Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Lycia,</hi> he was called <hi>Valdanio</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtronge, who inamored by heare ſay of <hi>Roſiluera,</hi> came to <hi>Trebizou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> with <hi>16</hi> Knights, whome hee diſperſt foure ſeuerall wayes for this intent, which was by anye meanes to ſteale her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for once in ſafety ſet in his Iſle gainſt all the vniuerſe he would defend her. In ſeing the Ladies, he knew whom he loued, and with extreame ioy hee cryed out. Oh <hi>Ioue</hi> may it be thou haſt kept for me ſuch good fortune? I wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it with rich ſacrifices vntil the death. He would not deferre it, ſuppoſing there might bee thereabouts her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance: ſo went he to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies that ſéemed more like dead coarſes then liuing creatures. She whome he loued, did ſhe barbarous Gyant take in his armes: a better prize ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any made, had Fortune fauored him to the end. The Engliſh Lady had more courage ſo ſhe ran into the thicket: whether the Knights would not followe her, but ſeing their

So ſoone as the Lady ſawe him, with great lamentation ſhe ſayd. So the heauens in all your actions bleſſe you (ſir Knight) ſuffer not this moſte vniuſt outrage to bee done mee. Straight did the Knight knowe her for many dayes ſince, had he made her the proper loue of his owne ſoule, tributarie to hers. For this was the haughtie <hi>Don Cellindo</hi> of the hidden groue, where he hadde ſéen the portrature of that Lady, who by chance was ſunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Siſter, nothing ſorrowing for it, to goe to <hi>Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zound</hi> &amp; ſée that Princeſſe that ſo had captiuated him.

               <p>Stay villanous Knight for ſo eaſilye is not the faireſt Flower of <hi>Trebizound</hi> to be carried away, in whoſe defence firſt will I looſe my life then ſee her ſuſtaine the leaſt iniury.

himſelfe being better mounted they loſte their waye in the wood, where they paid full dearely for their preſumption, for the furious <hi>Teferreo</hi> committing <hi>Artemiſa</hi> to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards kéeping, committed his fortunes to the running of his horſe til he met with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſhalbe expreſſed: returning now to <hi>Don Cellindo,</hi> wo ſeing himſelfe before his Lady, &amp; that battle to be for her libertie, he couched his launce with ſuch gallantnes, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> ſomewhat feared, they encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with more noiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the méeting of two Rockes: migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the <hi>Moore,</hi> yet notwithſtanding receaued he a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wound on his left breaſt, from whence iſſued much blood.

along vpon his horſe, without ſight and féeling: he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chaſe where he had ſurely ſlain him, had he not heard a voice that ſtaied him, It was the Ladies, that conſidering what the knight had done for her, would not be vngratefull for it, but in ſigne thereof, cauſed the battaile to ceaſe: thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (as indeed it was her <hi>Bembo</hi>) had the better. She roze from whence ſhee came, and in great haſt ranne to him in the blacke with theſe wordes. For my ſake ſir Knight leaue this battaile, whoſe victorie will yeild but little profite, and it were ill to repay his good will ſo, that with ſuch liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie offered to free me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead knight: he ſaw (though he was angrie) that the Ladie had reaſon in her wordes, and ſo replied. Soueraigne Princeſſe of <hi>Trebizound,</hi> although this Knight had greatly wronged me, I am content to leaue it in this eſtate ſo he will: he will, he will: (anſwered ſhee) if he will leaue me debtor, for that he hath done for me. In what maner the voice ſurpriz'd him, in the ſame he ſtood a good while, hauing his power ſubiect to no more then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bay the beauteous Ladie, to whome hee replied. My ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage being hereby the greateſt (moſt faire Princeſſe) I wiſh, it had been commaunded mee before (not now, this knight hath got the beſt) that your ſoueraigne beauty might haue been aſſured of my will, which is with my life to bee employed in your ſeruice vntill the death. In what maner ſoeuer you doe it, I accoumpt it no ſmall fauour ſir knight (did <hi>Roſiluera</hi> anſwere) ſince the cauſe to be reſpected is the wil that perfourms it, &amp; till ſome of my attendants come I pray you alight, that with ſome thing wee may binde your woundes. Both from their horſes leapt, and being Louers ſet all their felicitie in obeying Ladies. They put of their helmes, faire was the gallant youth <hi>Don Cellindo,</hi> more white then browne, and of ſo braue a conſtitution, that no Lady (being in loue) but would deſire to be of him.

Some comfort was this to <hi>Meridians</hi> Sonne, for to himſelfe hee ſayde. It was not poſſible hee ſhould loue where his ſight did not gaze theron. Oh valiant Princes who might pleaſe you, diſpleaſing neither, pardon, oh pardon mee ſwéete La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for my long progreſſing through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pathes of loues ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere puritie, for <hi>Don Cellindo</hi> gazing on her he loues, &amp; ſhee on him, ſhe had afore her on the other ſide, made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her beautie, iudge it but a parcell, or an abſtract draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the perfect modell of <hi>Lirianas</hi> perfections on whome his imagination did féede, accompting the greateſt euil for her ſake to be his chiefeſt ioy.</p>
               <p>The Lady ſpake (for in loue diſcourſes they haue greater power in this war of <hi>Venus,</hi> then <hi>Hector</hi> amonge <hi>Mars</hi> his

Moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princeſſe the certaineſt thing that I can tell of my name, is to knowe nothing of the ſame. In companye of a Siſter of mine a wiſe man brought me vpp, not telling vs who we are, but that I was called the hidden <hi>Don Cellyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> though now the fortunate Knight I am termed. It ſhold ſéeme they ſuſpected this would befall me, wherein I might doe you ſome ſeruice, although it may bee more aptly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the valour of this Knight.

I am ſure ſhe will now bee weary of paines, hauing reſerued for mee in <hi>Trebizound</hi> ſuch ſupreame good.

The one knewe no more of himſelfe then what he had ſayd. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neuer declared his name to any but <hi>Liriana.</hi> There ſtaid he eight dayes, which was but a momentary inſtant for the Ladye, that by a thouſand meanes woulde haue made him knowe her affection: but his was ſo great towards another that it woulde not ſo much as let him marke hers, thinking hee had byn ſtayed a whole age in <hi>Trebizound.</hi> Hee craued leaue for his departure to euery ones griefe for hee was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing who felt it worſe then death, was <hi>Roſiluera,</hi> though ſhe diſſembled it: in this ſhe exceld all Ladies of her time.

Is it poſſible friend <hi>Paliſandro</hi> (ſaid the Prince) that my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gréeues to ſee me abſent? I cannot beléeue it, for ſo great a good brings with it an incredulitie. He imbraſt him, for neuer had any Prince a more diſcréeter ſquyre, except <hi>Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> that was borne according to <hi>Roſabells</hi> humor. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things demaunded he of the Court, whoſe preſence did adorne it. Some griefe was to him hearing that all his kinſfolkes were there miſſing, not knowing the cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Great comfort did hee conceaue by ſeeing him, hee had made the Conſiſtorie, within whoſe ſecrecie he recorded his ſoules thoughts: imagining his companie would be a leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his paines, but that, which moſt did mittigate it, was the care his Foſter-father <hi>Galtenor</hi> had to ſuccour him. By this it was time to trauaile, ſo getting a horſe-backe, tooke their next way to the famouſe Citie of <hi>Zantho,</hi> aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing <hi>Paliſandro</hi> he ſhould by no meanes diſcouer what they were, more then that he was called the perſecuted knight, diſcourſe they did of many things, and the moſt of <hi>Archiſilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> when about two of the clocke after midday the rayes of the reuerberating ſunne vpon the ſtony walles of the Cittie, guilded their plumed toppes, whoſe ſtupendious buildings made them amazed with admiration. On the north ſide it hath <hi>Panonia:</hi> on the weſt <hi>Iſtria,</hi> on the Eaſt <hi>Myſia</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and on the ſouth the <hi>Adriaticke</hi> ſea. The wall was round moted with an arme of the famous <hi>Gerſian</hi> riuer, where (it is beléeued) that <hi>Iupiter</hi> firſt fell in Loue, and therefore did the Kings heere neuer want moſt beautifull daughters, as this now was, accoumpted the worlds machleſſe Paragon for gallantnes and beautie.</p>
               <p>The path which they hadde taken brought them vnto the bridge, whoſe paſſage the <hi>Siconians</hi> Son with his bretheren did defend. It was admirable in workmanſhippe, for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middeſt therof was edified a ſtately pallaice, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince and his brothers lodged. It reached vnto the Cittie wall, ending with a large and great plaine, payled in for the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, which the <hi>Siconian</hi> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded there to be made,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:135"/>
becauſe that way ſtood the Kings pallaice, from whoſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows might the ſecond <hi>Venus</hi> behold all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bates, though not with ſuch affection as the warlike <hi>Lindauro</hi> (ſo was the Prince named) could wiſh becauſe he was of himſelfe proud and inſolent being ſo mighty, which is the chiefeſt thinge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies doe abhorre. A tumult there was in the place, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke heard the noiſe of blowes, hee haſtened his horſe, ſo did his Page, to arriue in time to ſée the cauſe. Which was for that the Prince of <hi>Croatia</hi> with his two gyants had entred the bridge (before him) deſirous to reuenge his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens diſgrace, with ſuch fury did <hi>Claridiano</hi> croſſe the ſame, that euery one beholding the fight was moued to laughter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with ſo mornefull deuiſe. Thrée of the brothers had <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> Prince of <hi>Croatia</hi> ouerthrowne &amp; returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fourth, he encountred him ſo brauely, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the launce ſlyding from his ſhielde to the right ſide, which beeing of a knotty Oake ere it broke, thrée pats thereof appeared at the other ſide, tumbling his enemie dead at his féete to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers extreme griefe. There was none there but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the azure knight, for of this colour was his deuiſe: who like an angry Lyon made towards the haughty <hi>Lindauro.</hi> They met with more ferrocity then the roaring of raging waters beating within the cauers of hollow rocks. Valiant were the louers, but both were vnhorſt. Of the two falls the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was the <hi>Croatians,</hi> becauſe he held the bridle in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. Recouer would he his ſeate to end the reſt of the battles but the Iudges on <hi>Lindauros</hi> behalfe, did put him from it, ſaying he was vanquiſht. Not I (replyed the youth) ſince we both fel on our féet. Thats al one (ſaid they) for you, to wyn, were bound not to leaue your ſaddle, though your aduerſary dyd looſe his. To that paſſe came the matter that the Prince of <hi>Croatias</hi> gyants ſtept among them, ſaying that he in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> azure was not ouercome, but that he might proſecute his battle, &amp; that they would maintayne it gainſt all the world. Leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous tumult ſhould happen the King deſcended, to whom the Iudgement of the combate was remitted: verie
<pb facs="tcp:13977:136"/>
neere approched the Gréeke determined to take the <hi>Croati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> part thought it ſhold coſt him his life, for his valor ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the Iuſtes had drawen his affection. So did the Kinge greatly affect <hi>Lindauro,</hi> &amp; becauſe he was ſo great a Prince, and ſo néere neighbour to him, it had moued him in ſecret to giue him hope of his Daughter <hi>Venus</hi> that none but he ſhold haue her, although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lady one day her father talked w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it made anſwere contrary to her ſires expectations. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he would not openly diſgrace the ſtranger, but onely that hee could not procéede farther in fight, looſing his horſe and ſhield. Forward came the angry Gréeke with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious rage ſhaking like an aſpen leafe, &amp; lifting vp his Beuer ſayd. Notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> againſt what ſo wiſe a king hath decréede nothing ought to be ſayd, neuertheleſſe (ſauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, &amp; honor due to your imperiall Crowne &amp; ſtate) in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the knight may continue his battailes to the end, for this being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt, it is certaine it went at al aduenture, either procuring the maintenance of his owne fame. If there any wanted to Iuſt yet were there in this difficulty, reſting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thrée knights choice to aſſault him on foote or otherwiſe, but to remaine vanquiſhed at leaſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out his horſe, your maieſtie hath iudged it, &amp; it may be the beſt, yet in my countrey it is not vſed. This highly gladded the beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> who ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pollidolphos</hi> haughty déedes was viſited by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the blinde God. There ſtood a Knight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſtrongeſt in all <hi>Slauonia,</hi> a kinſeman of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings, who hearing the Gréeks ſpéeches, ſtept forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe words. It ill beſéemes thée knight to repugne what my Lorde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kinge hath iudged. Incompaſſed round about with knights and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty <hi>Alphebos</hi> ſonne, which was ſome cauſe that he replyed with more méekenes then he would, &amp; ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. What the king hath decréede (ſir Knight) I approue &amp; allowe for good, but if vpon thy proude &amp; arrogant wordes ſpoken thou dareſt accept this my gage, Ile teach thée that ſtrangers comming to ſerue kings ought to bee intreated w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more courteſie. In this kingdome (ſayd the third Brother &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13977:136"/>
ſhe valianteſt) muſt not be admitted ſo vniuſt a battle as you demaunde, but rather ſuch as you ought to bee puniſhed as troublers of the Court. The limits of patience did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince paſſe, hee preſumed on more then <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Iupiter</hi> durſt, anſwering. Diſcourteous inſolent art thou knight, &amp; thereupon that thou mayſt knowe, how little I eſteme thée, thou mayſt enter to the battle with this knight, in company of thy bretheren, for the proude wordes vttered cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended with leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all your heads. The haughty challeng admired eury one iudging it a meere madneſſe, &amp; in fayth any other vndertaking it but the Gréeke prince, it could not but be called wil-ful temeritie, for either of the 4 might haue copt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Milo.</hi> The king allowed the challeng, greatly deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be reuenged on the knight, but the 4 Knights would not accompting it cowardiſe to aſſault one, &amp; rather euerye one for himſelfe, would vndertake the battle, thinking (not knowing the challenger) it was ſuffitient. But hee to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them ſayde. Knights it befits you not with effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reaſons to refuſe the battle, ſéeming thereby more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlyke then valiant. This altogether blinded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo all 4 vpon mighty horſes, ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt the <hi>Grecian Mars.</hi> Now <hi>Mercury</hi> would I faine ſée thée here to draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect lineaments of this braue battle. <hi>Orpheus</hi> tonge in this effect were but blunt, for either is abaſhed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other to haue help againſt one ſole aduerſary: with greater horror prickt forth the fiue warriours then the racking cloudes rent with a fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Thunder-bolt.</p>
               <p>The earth neuer ſaw a ſtronger, nor fiercer incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for euery one thinking to end the battle with his blowe met him with ſuch fiercenes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none miſt his ſtroke. To bee hit by ſo many was a help to ſtay him in his ſaddle. They torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nted his body w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtrength of their ſeueral launces, for few greater incounters had he receaued. He helde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe valiantly, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out making any ſhamefull motion in his ſeate he met y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt brother w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch puiſſance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he made him fly from his ſaddle, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his proude breſt pierced ſide, through
<pb facs="tcp:13977:137"/>
ſide: he turned vpon the thrée that with ſome feare ſtaid for him, ſeeing how mighty he had ſhewe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. All in the place were ſtruck as in a traunce with admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſaw him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yellow, how w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſword in one hand, &amp; ſhield in another, he thruſt himſelfe amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his enemies, with far greater courage then if he had to doe but with one. In his charge with that good ſword that <hi>Galtenor</hi> had giuen him he ſtruck the Kings couzen vppon his helme. All his plumes he cut away, with the top thereof, wounding him moſt dangerouſly on the head: he could not defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of them all, for the brothers at once, laid vpon his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable helme, the which although they could not raſe, yet forſt they him to make an vnpleaſing muſike with his téeth, bowing his head below his breſt. Through rage y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Elclauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued to be wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded he diſcharged on the Gréeks left ſhoulder al his ſtrength, it ſo torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could ſcarce hold his ſhield. The other two ſecond it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeuerall thruſts. Twas their aduantage for the ſecond brother quickly repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe ſtryking him vnder the right arme. The ſwoord chanſt to light outwardly els it had mortally wounded him, for it fell betwene the buckling of the armor nere the breſt. It wounded him, though but little, yet altogether to ſet the Greeke on the ſpurs of furie. Being once at this point (<hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi> ſaith being he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cronicled his acts) he was feareful to be beheld. Hee manifeſted it, for not regarding the other thruſt (which put him to great paine) he floriſhed his ſword among the thrée. He could not miſſe the Kinges couzen, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away al his armor on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſide with a piece of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhield: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paſt the blowe lighting on the ſecond brothers Beuer, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding him there very da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerouſly, &amp; alſo the blod y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iſſued hindred his eie-ſight. He turnd with a counterbuffe vpon the third (this was the ſtrongeſt of them) it beate him vpon hys horſe without féeling. The king ſeing it cried out amazedly. O <hi>Saturne</hi> (what haughty corage is this of one knight) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in oh mighty <hi>Ioue</hi> haue I offended thée, that thou ſhouldeſt ſend him hithirto ſhame, &amp; diſgrace my Court? for al that no
<pb facs="tcp:13977:137"/>
iot of fayntnes ſhewed the other twoo, beating on his helme like an anuell, which ſeemed to be of a light fier ſo many ſparkes flue from it. Seing with what valour that knight defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the azures part, the ſecond <hi>Venus</hi> ſhewed her ſelfe more faire then did the firſt, when ſhee Courted young <hi>Adonis</hi> in the wood, from the window ſhe looked, glad that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> azure knight withdrew not his eyes from her caſement, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading her ſelfe ſhe might be ſure of his faith. In a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull fight were the twoe with the Gréeke louer, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third brother, recouering himſelfe, &amp; caſting his ſhield at his backe went to him. He aſſailed him on the ſodaine, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtryking him at his pleaſure, executing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braueſt blowe he did in all his life: for he tooke him on the very top of hys helme with ſuch ſtrength that he fell on his horſe necke. All of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> followed the chaſe, laying on him moſt cruell blows. The new-come would faine haue cloſed within the Gréeke, &amp; ſo offered it. It had byn very ill for <hi>Claridiano</hi> becauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others, ſo he auoyded it, by ſpurring his ſwift Courſer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him leape from them. After him followed the two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him together on his ſwords arme. Twas a venturous blowe, for it ſo paind it that he could not ſtir it. There was none in the place but perceaued it, nor anye but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly grieued thereat, eſpecially <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> in his ſoule, who gazed on the battle with ſuch affection as if he were his brother. Their good fortune did his enemies imbrace, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out feare entring, and ſalying, hammering his ſoule more then his body, ſo great was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath kindled in his furious breſt. By little and little he felt the paine diminiſh: Aſwell as he might he defended himſelfe, not without mighty blowes of the thrée, that to make an end drew ſtrength from their fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for he had wounded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dangerouſly. At length féeling himſelfe frée of the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, faining neuertheleſſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, he ſuffered the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d brother to enter for he was moſt eager. When he was ſo neare he could not ſcape him, hee rayſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft his reuenging arme, with more ſtrength, then wyth whéeles the mightieſt burthens are crayned vpp, &amp; with as
<pb facs="tcp:13977:138"/>
much rage as courage hee diſcharged it on his helme, the which downe to the ſhoulders with his head was clouen. Great was the noiſe that ſodenly aroze in the place with the knights death, thinking the like would happen to the reſt. The like preſumed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſo did <hi>Lindauro,</hi> that bloody teares did ſhed for the loſſe of the brothers. Redoubled was their gréefe, for <hi>Archiſiloras</hi> louer imagining he too lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g deferred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end: flung at the Kings Couzen wounding him with ſuch a blow, that ſenceleſſe he caſt him forwards on his horſe neck, he ran againſt him with his Courſers breſt, tumbling him &amp; his horſe on the ſtony pauement more dead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue. The third brother would defend himſelfe, but the Prince thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it vnméet to aſſault him, did cloſe caſting his ſtrong armes about him wherewith he pluct him from his ſaddle, &amp; ſpurring his horſe went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridge ſide offering to caſt him into the riuer ouer the railes: whereat the King cried out to him he ſhould not doe it, for he gaue him the victorie of the fight, accompting him the beſt knight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. To do your Maieſtie ſome ſeruice which is my ſole deſire (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince) I am content to do it, although his rude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilitie deſerues a farre greater puniſhment.

The Gréeke replyed knowing him to be whom the Knight hadde ſayd. This &amp; far much more then I haue done is due to your gentlenes, &amp; bounty (great Prince) for there is none (kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing what it is) but remaineth ingaged thereto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Come w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me knight (ſayd the King) &amp; I will doe you right, for it hath not a litle greued me, this tumult ſhold haue befallen on this day, which I hoped for my greteſt content:
<pb facs="tcp:13977:143"/>
vnder your royall woord, I will doe it (replied <hi>Claridiano</hi>) truſting that if I haue any excuſe it ſhall auaile me. Feare not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> (ſir knight ſaid <hi>Venus</hi> Vncle) for on my perill here ſhal you not receaue any more wrong. To him comaunded the King, he and <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> ſhould deliuer their ſwords, who through his wounds was not able to ſtirre. Of him had the Kings brother in law charge, to the Princes extreame ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thinking his ſundring from the <hi>Greeke</hi> would be his vntimely death. Hee was deceaued, for the Ladie had as much care of him as if he were in her chamber ſhewing her Vncle manifeſt tokens that ſhée loued the <hi>Croatian</hi> which nothing diſpleaſed him, thinking he was a knight of great accompt, &amp; excéedingly reioyced when afterwards he knew how great a Prince hee was. The <hi>Greeke</hi> they committed to a ſtrong tower not farre from the Ladies lodging, whoſe cuſtodie a Couzen of the Kings had, that like a good knight cauſed him to be well cured though he was ſo weake of his loſt blood, that he could not arize from his bed, yet his anger and rage more tormented him then his wounds, arryuing a thowſand times at the point of death only for that he could not come to be reuenged on the trecherous <hi>Lindauro.</hi> Who for all he was wounded, thought it well imployed, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they could not from thence eſcape without death or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting infamie. For which intent he one day ſecretly ſent for the King of the <hi>Cremonian</hi> Iſle, the mightieſt <hi>Pagan</hi> that was knowen on the earth, for with one ſonne whome a little before he had knighted, he had vanquiſhed twoo great Hoaſts. He was in peace and had contracted league with them: and aduertiſing them the neceſſitie he had of their helpes, with foure Knights of their kindred they came thether in poaſt, and ſending <hi>Lindauro</hi> word of their arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, they did what the enſuing Chapter doth relate.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIIII.</hi> How the Princes were by ſome ſtrange Knights challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the battaile, and what about it happened.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch is the power (ſole wonders of heauens beauties, and onely admirations of earthly miracles) of an amorous paſſion rooted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tender ſoule of a blind louer, that it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him, reſpecting no reſpect of proper ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to attempt thoſe things manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: for once fully poſſeſt of the louer, it tramples with diſdaine on the gouernment of reaſon, guiding the affection with the looſe raignes of a ſelfe-will, the which hauing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned an vncontrolled regiment, doth commaund as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Empreſſe of the minde: this is that which only guides <hi>Lindauro,</hi> who becauſe hee was a louer, &amp; in preſence of hys Lady to ſée himſelfe wounded, &amp; his thrée Brothers ſlayne, &amp; yet vnreuenged, conceaued ſo great a paſſionate deſire of ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, that not regarding the laws of Knight-hood, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; his Royal reputation an vniuſt reuenge vpon the Gréeke louer, a thing that redounded to his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſhame, and diſhonour eternall. He conferred it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the King, who being determined to obſerue, and by Iuſtice and right to determine that controuerſie, inclyned to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcréete ſonne in lawes perſwaſions, animated thereto by the arryuall of the two Gyants, on whoſe valour the prince ſo firmely builded becauſe he thought none wold dare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter combate with them. Being thus determined, one daye (diſſembling his knowledge) they entred the great hall, clad in reſplending rich abilliments of warre. There was none but only with their ſight did tremble: for though they were not of deformed proportion, yet were they of ſo ſtronge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ioynts, and bigge timbered ſinewes, that plainely they demonſtrated the ſtrength of their armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:144"/>The Father rayſing his viſor with a hollowe voyce thus ſayd. Mighty Potentate of <hi>Eſclauonia,</hi> in our Land of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> we heard of ſome brawles thou haſt had with certaine ſtrange Knights, and this daye was it toulde vs their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence committed in thy preſence, killing ſome of thy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and wounding our Prince <hi>Lindauro,</hi> and moreouer howe thou haſt promiſed to deale with them by lawe: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt offendors to Princes ſtates no ſuch reſpecte is due, but to execute the power of conſuming wrath vppon them. And ſo vppon the one, and the other wee defie two Knights whatſoeuer that will vndertake the battaile, by the ſame will I defende they worthely deſerue a cruell death: Hee made them ſit downe knowing who they were, ſaying. I would not (braue Gyants) for any thinge haue it ſayd, that in my Court Iuſtice is leſſe obſerued then in anye other of the vniuerſe, and therfore did I referre this cauſe vnto my Counſell: but ſéeing you haue challenged them, there is no more but to admitte your challenge, aduertiſing them thereof.</p>
               <p>Well did <hi>Alanio</hi> the Princeſſe Vncle vnderſtoode the drift, and by whome that complotte was ordayned, grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that ſo great iniuſtice ſhoulde bee permitted. The beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> did nothing but wéepe, purpoſing wyth her owne handes rather to ſacrifice her life then to wedde ſo falſe a Knight. At length came the twoo Princes ſo weake and faint, that they were not able to ſtande, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye fewe there were in the Hall, but greatly did pittie them. Straight was it toulde them the cauſe why they were ſent for, and what thoſe Knights demaunded.</p>
               <p>Somewhat was the Prince mooued with their ſight, but that being paſt as long it laſted not, hee ſayde with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed animoſitie, that it pleaſed him ſtraight without any further delaye to enter the battaile, affying onelye on his Iuſtice. That maye not bee (aunſwered the Kinges counſell, who all were agréed againſt him) for there is an inuiolate law in this Kingdome (ſince <hi>Xantho</hi> the firſt King
<pb facs="tcp:13977:144"/>
thereof was challenged) that none challenged maye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate his propper cauſe, but preſent his Champion, within the limitted time prefixt to finde him, that he, for him, may right him or elſe fayling in eyther, or in both, to remayne ſubiect to the Lawes inflicting puniſhment. But we being ſtrangers of ſuch remoted Countries (ſayde the inraged Gréeke) and the finding a friend to hazard for vs his life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo difficult, great is the wronge herein you doe vs, and on both I will enter the battaile. Afore him ſtept the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King of <hi>Cremania</hi> with theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>Well doeſt thou knowe Knight howe impoſſible it is for thy ſake to vyolate the lawes for the common good eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo becauſe thou ſhalt not bee permitted to it, makes thée ſo vehemently inſiſt in thy requeſt. That mooues mee not to it (replyed the angry Gréeke,) but onely to ſée the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t pride that hither hath brought thée, not like a Knight, but a barking rauening Curre of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> that liue by how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the ſplendor of the bright <hi>Moone.</hi> So furious was the <hi>Pagan</hi> that hee would haue flung at him, which had not gréeued the Prince, for hee ſo ſpake purpoſelye to vexe him. Betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtept the King, commanding them to be conuayed to priſon, firſt lymiting them a Moneth to ſéeke their defendors. So furious reſted the <hi>Pagan,</hi> that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe his mouth hee foamed lyke a Boare, a thouſand times intreating the King to permit the battaile to the Knight, but hee ſo feared the Prince that by no meanes hee woulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée thereto, perſwading himſelfe he had his reuenge more ſurer that way.</p>
               <p>Neuer was gelded Bull nor mountaine Lyoneſſe nor hee himſelfe in all his lyfe more madde, then <hi>Claridiano</hi> was at that inſtant, to ſée himſelfe incloſed within a ſtonye wall, which made him roare like a chaffed Beare. <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> ſaith that as hee hadde afore béene a <hi>Pagan,</hi> hee ſo let his tongue paſſe the limittes of reaſon, that forgetting his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee let ſlippe ſome blaſphemies. <hi>Galtenor</hi> no other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth ſaue that he would not that night ſup, nor go to bed,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:145"/>
for all what the Phiſitions, and Chirurgions vrged it ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued for his health. All the night walked he imagining what remedie he might deuiſe to yſſue foorth to be reuenged on thoſe villaines: he was about to caſt himſelfe downe the Tower, but it was timeritie, conſidering the heighth. In no leſſe anguiſh was <hi>Pollidolpho,</hi> yet ſomething more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Alanios</hi> kindnes that reputed him a perſon both of valour and high eſtéeme. In nothing could he better ſhew it then in that extremitie. But the beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand plottes deuiſed (mooued with pure loue) to ſée if anye woulde preuayle. None was good, nothing pleaſed her, ſaue ſolitude that was her comfort, and if merily ſhe looked on her Father it was with diſſembling her inward gréefe, which was the greateſt that euer Ladie did indure. With <hi>Fauſta</hi> her gentlewoman ſhee diſburdened her heart, for Thouſand doubts perſwaded her ſhe ſhould ſuffer ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which ſhe thought could be but little, how great ſoeuer, happening for remedie &amp; releaſe of thoſe Princes, for whom ſhe would hazard lyfe and honour. Sixe dayes of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie were paſt, and no Knight appeared to accept the battle, nor none in the Court durſt doe it, iudging madneſſe to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it againſt the Father and Sonne.</p>
               <p>Verie fewe were in the Court but lamented the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table certaine death of the Knightes, and aboue all <hi>Alanio,</hi> not knowing what meanes to deuiſe to eſchewe it, becauſe the King ſtill inſiſted in his rygorous obſtinacie, vrged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with continuall perſwaſions of that trecherous <hi>Lindauro</hi> of <hi>Syconia.</hi> Her griefe did the fayre <hi>Venus</hi> ſmother out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but alone ſhe ſhed more teares the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name did whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe bewayled the obſequies of her deare <hi>Adonis.</hi> One after-noone with her diſcréete <hi>Fauſta</hi> ſhee walked into a Garden, (where none but ſhe and her Damozells vſed to ſport them in tyme of ſolace) to giue her thoughtes the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of their vnbrydled penſiueneſſe, which by ſo manye wayes was aſſayled.</p>
               <p>It was their good Fortune, (by the Fates appointed that
<pb facs="tcp:13977:145"/>
thoſe Princes ſhould not ſo iniuſtly dye) to leade them to a place where they ſatte downe hard by certaine thicke gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen buſhes, and as <hi>Fauſta</hi> pluckt vppe ſome of the rooted braunches to ſit vpon, ſhe ſpyed a great hole like to a Caues mouth. She was aſtoniſhed thereat, ſuppoſing ſome beaſt or Adder to bee in it that might hurt them: the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of demaunded the afflicted <hi>Venus,</hi> and being tould yt, the amorous Ladye ſayd.</p>
               <p>Oh I would to <hi>loue</hi> it were ſo, that by taking away my lyfe, it would end ſo many deaths which I indure, for there is no hart longer able to tollerate ſo much. She roſe with more courage then her tenderneſſe allowed, &amp; taking away the buſhes to ſée what it was, they eſpied a Caue that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pallace bended, of ſuch widenes that twoo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men might eaſilie paſſe through it. She expected no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſolution, for couragiouſly, and with great bouldnes (for in the end ſhe was in Loue) ſhe entred it, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Fauſta</hi> to followe her, for though ſhee loſt her life ſhee would know what was in it, and find the end therof: your beautie will vnder-goe too great a bouldnes (ſaid ſhe) and I would not for any thing we ſhould be ſpied.</p>
               <p>There is no danger to bee feared nor yet that wee ſhould be ſeene ſayde <hi>Venus</hi>) for conſidering the ſafetie of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it is impoſſible that any ſhould haue come hither. They had not gone Fiftiepaces, when they founde themſelues at the foote of a ſtone wall, yt was ſo darke that verie litle light they could ſée, but yet they felt what it was. They went about (hand in hand, for let go they durſt not) to ſée if they could finde any ſteps or ſtayres in the wall becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caue there ended. At length they met with their deſire, but it was ſo narrowe that one could ſcarce goe vp. They put of their Pantoffles to doe it better, &amp; the Princeſſe began to mount trembling like an Aſpen leafe ſo did <hi>Fauſta,</hi> who though ſhe helde her Miſtres be her ſléeue, yet was not able to goe vpp a ſtep, which were aboue Fortie, and with extreme feare hauing aſcended them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they came to the top, they were
<pb facs="tcp:13977:146"/>
ſo wearie they could not ſtirre. They ſate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe awhile to breath, ſpeaking ſo ſoftly, that they themſelues could not almoſt heare one another: what ſhall wée doe (faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe ſaid <hi>Fauſta</hi>) if in the Pallaice our abſence ſhalbe found, no doubt but it will be noted, and iudged I feare for wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? That the Caue would bring vs (replied <hi>Venus</hi>) to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tower of the deſpairing knight, then would I not care what the world ſhould ſay, for he being ſet at libertie, the ſame would he procure to vs all? Such goodnes will not our hap abode vs (ſaid <hi>Fauſta</hi>) to let it be ſo, for then who with a more iuſt title could bragge of felicitie? let vs rize (ſaid <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) for my hart is paſſing light, and let vs ſée where we ſhall arriue. They went ſoftly féeling (fearing to be heard) till they met of the ſame ſtone, one of the faſhion of a doore, that arteficially was ſet in the wall: they were not able to ſtir it becauſe it was to be opened on the inſide of the tower, though many hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred yeres twas it had not bin opened, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was the reaſon none of the Court, neither knew it, nor any ſuch thing euer imagined. <hi>Lirgandeo</hi> ſaith it was made by a Perſian king, that fell in loue with <hi>Licida</hi> daughter of <hi>Xa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho,</hi> who being lodged in the tower, and ſéeing her walke in that garden, with the force of his armes brake downe the wall till he came to the earth, where with more facilitie he proſecuted his amorous intent, making then that Caue as they found it, by which meanes he obtayned the Ladies will, bringing her that way vnto his chamber, till he found time to ſteale her and conuay her to his Kingdome. To this rape doth <hi>Aſtildo</hi> attribute the cauſe of <hi>Perſias</hi> deſolation, by the Father of the ſtolen Ladie. This was the dore that now the Ladies found where attentiuely hearkening (becauſe it was very nigh to the bedde of the deſpayring knight) they might heare him with Millions of ſighes complaine him in this manner.</p>
               <p>O Quéene of <hi>Lyra</hi> (ſaid the Prince of <hi>Gretia</hi>) how maieſt thou nowe liue contented, ſéeing thy crueltie hath abſented me from my countrey. and thy deuine preſence, which was
<pb facs="tcp:13977:146"/>
the thinge whoſe power might nouriſh an abhorred life, that nowe doth kéepe me incloſed within a ſtonie limmit, wounded, ſicke and weake, and where none with helpe can preuaile to liberate him from a cruell and ſhamefull death, that only wiſhes a tormented life to adore thy beautie? O deare Father <hi>Galtenor,</hi> this is the time wherein thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſhewe thy loue towardes thy Sonne, on whome thou ſometime diddeſt put thy glorie, and the recouerie of thy whole Kingdome. Regard with what will I hazarded my life for thy content. I onlie require thée to ſet me at libertie, that I maye bee reuenged on theſe villanous Traitors: which if I might obtaine, I would not then gréeue at any thing that I haue ſuſtayned ſo I might make them know, and alſo teach them howe they ſhould entertaine valiant Knights.</p>
               <p>O Emperour <hi>Trebatio</hi> my Lord and Grandſire, knewe you my anguiſh and gréefe, I know you would reuenge it. O <hi>Claridiana</hi> my ſoueraigne Lady Mother, who would tell you that your beloued Son hath but xxiiij. daies of life lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by a mortall man, with lyke affection would you put on your armor to reſcue me, as when you went to ſéeke the great <hi>Alphebo</hi> my louing Father, The Prince ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that none did heare him, which in déede might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well bee, for that Tower was hygher then any of the reſt. Great ioye conceaued the Ladyes with the fynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of ſo braue an aduenture, and ſéeing how that waye they myght frée him, that hee might ſo doe by the Prince <hi>Pollidolpho:</hi> yet moſt woundered, that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee was ſo highe a Prince, Nephewe and Sonne to thoſe that with their haughtie déedes hadde illuſtrated the ſpacious world.</p>
               <p>Of him (being ſo young) they had not heard, but what they had ſéene was ſuffitient reaſon for to mooue them to eſteame him for the beſt and moſte worthieſt Knight that euer guirded ſwoord. Returne we nowe my <hi>Fauſta</hi> (ſayd
<pb facs="tcp:13977:147"/>
the gallant <hi>Venus</hi>) for ſo happie an aduenture as this, could not but be kept for ſo great a neceſſitie as ours, and we will giue order that (vnknowen to the Prince) the doore may be opened vs by his ſquyre, for he is wittie, and will do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intreated: but goe wée ſoftly leaſt wée be heard. Then let vs be gone (ſaid ſhee) and I knowe not what it is that Knights can ſéeke, ſince your beauteous ſelfe hath diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an aduenture ſo hard &amp; difficult, &amp; of ſuch perill. There is none now (ſaid the Lady) giuing the deſpairer armor, for when I ſée him with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gainſt all the world I liue aſſured, though it would iniurie me. Come let vs away, (replyed the Damozell) for that confidence hath in Loue moſt force. And if ſo we might liberate the deſpayring knight we néede not harbour the leaſt feare. A good ſucceſſe I doe not doubt, for fortune hath reſerued for this buſines (anſwered <hi>Venus</hi>) ſince it pleaſed her with ſo good a beginning to diſcouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the way vnto ſo ſure a hope. They came away, &amp; that no Lady walking that way might finde the Caue, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered it againe with thoſe buſhes &amp; briers the beſt that they could. No body had miſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe they thought they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked according to their cuſtome about thoſe greene arbors. That afternoone procured the Damozell to ſpeake with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſandro,</hi> which happened as ſhee deſired, for ſhe ſpied him croſſe by the tower where his Maiſter lay. Shée made him ſignes to come to her, which he did, and becauſe ſhee would not prolong their conuerſation, leaſt they might be eſpied, ſhe ſaid. Good ſquire it hath ſo gréeued vs the Princeſſe my Lady &amp; my ſelfe, to ſée the impriſonment of thy Lord that we cannot expreſſe it, and therfore we haue procured a meanes to frée him from it, ſo our good hap was to ſhew vs to day a Caue, that from my Ladies garden reacheth to thy Lords chamber, which we could not open, though we heard him complaine of many things, and we alredy know how great a Prince he is: and that he may performe what to my Lady Miſtres he promiſed, ſhe will ſet him at liberty, that he may procure it for the other Knight. Of neither aduertiſe him,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:147"/>
but onely open the dore which in the ſame wall you ſhall ſée of ſtone, that we may on the ſodian enter, for it will ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſe my Lady <hi>Venus.</hi> And becauſe this matter requires a ſecret breuitie no more, but, that this night after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions be gone, ſtay you with a light, to doe what I tell, for we will not fayle you. The diſcréete <hi>Paliſandro</hi> toke his leaue, pondering that matter in his minde, as the waighte thereof required. In the end he reſolued to doe yt, vnable to imagine that in ſo great a Princeſſe there ſhoulde bee anye thinge ment contrary to what ſhee ſayde. After the Prince was dreſſed <hi>Palizandro</hi> ſhut the dores verye faſt, to execute his appointment, and hee found their tale to bee true which not a little gladded him, ſeeing that his Maiſter might that way goe foorth: hee opened the wall, and ſet a taper by his Maiſters bed ſide, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ladies might ſée him, &amp; was about himſelfe to goe méete them, but he feared to diſpleaſe them. They ſtayed not long, for the houſhold being withdrawne, with Summer garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, they deſcended to the garden, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king faſt the dore after them. The Princeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> woare a Damaſke mantle imbroydered with gold, caſt ouer a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coate of ruſſet Satten layd about with golden lace, vpon her haire ſhe had a Lawne of curled Cypers, which ſo reuerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the beames of her owne beauty vpon her ſelfe, that no Knight (not louing <hi>Archiſilora</hi>) could haue the hart to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her. In beauty onely thrée contayned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to equall her, &amp; yet they knew not any aduantage ouer her, the firſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rezited Lady, <hi>Roſamond</hi> &amp; <hi>Liriana.</hi> They went more nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler by reaſon of their light garments, which made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er mount to the ſtaire head whence through the tapeſtry that hung before the dore, they ſpyed the light. With a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d imaginations were the Prince &amp; <hi>Paliſandro</hi> expecting what might fall out. At the entring they ſtarted as it were wyth feare in ſuch ſort that they made not ſo little noiſe but the Prince might heare it, he feared ſome treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and though he had no armor at the time that he would leape out of his bed, entred with her damozell that excellent Ladye who with a
<pb facs="tcp:13977:148"/>
ioyfull countenance able to reuiue a dying man, ſayd. Did you thinke (ſir Knight) to paſſe ſo ſorrowfull a life, and we not come to receaue part of your griefe, the which if it might be deuided there ſhould not want one, ſo you might be ryd thereof, to take the greateſt part. Ryſe would the Prince admired not onely of her beautie, but of the meanes ſhe had to come thither. The Lady would not ſuffer him, nor giue him her handes, which the Gréeke inſtantly required, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he was before his deare Quéene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> he replyed. Much am I behoulding to my griefe (moſt excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) ſince it is the cauſe that cauſeth me to acknowledge an eternall duety to your high ſeruice, for this kinde remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the which being immerited by a Knight ſo vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as my ſelfe, ſtopps me from binding my ſelfe any more then that I heretofore do owe, nor can I beléeue there ſhold be ſtrength to aduance mee in any thinge, more then I haue promiſed: Neuertheleſſe of my life maye your beauteous ſelfe diſpoſe, which to loſe wil be a happines perpetual, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing yours thereby to your content, the which to mee would be excéeding to knowe what waye you found hither to bring you: No other hath it béen replyed ſhe, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I was to ſée you at libertie, ioyned with the griefe I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, imagining howe greatly yours would be with my Fathers offerred wronges: For this daye walking to take the ayre into my Garden with this my Damoſell, amonge certaine buſhes wee founde a Caue, that hitherto arriues. I loſt all feare with the will I had to haue you from hence, that I paſt the ſame till wee mette with this dore, deferring our comming againſt this time, and we heard you ſo bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaine, that I knowe not what to ſaye of the Quéene of <hi>Lyra,</hi> whether ſhe be in fault or the Prince of <hi>Grecia.</hi> It ioyes mee to ſée you ſo well beſtowed, though to ill repayd: Stormes are they to the <hi>Laberithian</hi> Seas of Louers inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſtill pretending a more happy calme.</p>
               <p>If therefore in the meane time that your content is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you will receaue it, by hearing to whom theſe wrongs
<pb facs="tcp:13977:148"/>
are done we will, tell it. Greatly diſconted reſted the Prince hearing that the Ladye knewe him but hee diſſembled it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying. Well doe you expreſſe the greatnes of your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie (moſte gracious Princeſſe) hauing procured lyfe to him that incertaine hadde it, your owne affaires haue you therein done, for it ſhall not leſſe be employed then in your ſeruice, though to deſerue ſo great an aduenture as you this day haue diſcouered, a higher perſon ſhould haue béen kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, to celebrate with her due honour that it merits. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſt highlye ſhall I reſt ſatiſfied, in reuealing my name and eſtate to none, the which I haue tould onelye to my friende the Prince <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> of <hi>Croatia,</hi> which is hee that is in priſon, and yet that were pleaſant, hadde hee but promiſe of ſome remedy, not of libertie, but of comfort, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to beare the bondes wherein your perfections haue inthrald him.</p>
               <p>More liuelyer colours then the bluſhing Roſe poſſeſt in her chiefe pride, be-paynted the deuine heauen of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lady hearing what the Prince had ſayde, ſhee would not diſpleaſe him through want of hope, and therefore thus replyed. I would not haue had you (deſpayring Knight) that with ſuch deſpaire, and to my coſt, tell me the ametie twixt you and that Prince: But becauſe you ſhall not ſaye that in <hi>Eſclauonia</hi> there raigneth crueltie equall to that in <hi>Greece,</hi> let vs order your libertie, for after it ſhall not want for your friende, for I will neither nowe nor at anye time gaine-ſaie what you ſhall appoint mee, becauſe a Knight of your valour and qualitie will not procure but what may moſt glorifie my honour. The ioyfulleſt in the worlde would the Prince kiſſe her hands, accompting <hi>Pollidolpho</hi> the happyeſt in the vniuerſe, hauing with ſo fewe ſoules tormentes and heart oppreſſing paſſions of a deſpayring Melancholie loue, obtayned the moſt rareſt Iewell on the earth, the pureſt fayreſt, and moſt immaculte.</p>
               <p>You ſée valyant Prince (fayde the Ladies) what the Kinge my Father hath ordayned, and the danger that your
<pb facs="tcp:13977:149"/>
lyfe incurres, yf for all the weakenes and debilitie you now are in you will vndertake the battle, to morrow at this time I will prouide you with the beſt armour that my Fathers whole Kingdome doth containe, neuer of any ſéene, and the reſt I refer to your diſcretion: and that you may not be miſt, I had imagined that <hi>Fauſta</hi> my damozell ſhould remayne in bed in your ſtéede, (for in more then this doth ſhee deſire to pleaſure you, and we will giue forth that you lye at the point of death, becauſe the King my Father may not ſend for you, neyther for the challenge nor to ſée the battaile. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether this counſell likes you, if not, we will ſeeke ſome other better. There is none (deare Princeſſe) anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Prince, farr more eſtéeming her for her wit &amp; diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: why then (ſayd ſhe) take reſt and courage, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe we will be with you, and commaunde your Squire to publiſh what I ſaid of your infirmitie, for I haue vnderſtood that by your valour you haue obtayned manye friendes in Court, that will helpe you with the vtmoſt of their powers, and I will procure that your friend ſhall commit his title &amp; right of the battaile to your good fortune. And thereupon ſhe imbraſt him, (which <hi>Ioue</hi> had thought a happier lyfe had it béene done to him then to bee God of Gods) and returned with her belooued <hi>Fauſta</hi> to her Chamber, where they paſt the night, with repetition of Knights qualities and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.</p>
               <p>The next daye <hi>Palizandro</hi> publiſhed with manye teares (though fayned) the great infirmitie of hys Maiſter the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing Knight, and how he would not be ſpoken to by any by reaſon he was on the exteameſt moment of his life. Some there were that greatly bewailed his ſuppoſed end. Others blinded with a fawning flattery, at euery ſlight occaſion to ſhew it, ſéemed then to inſinuate with the Kinge by ioyning with his vniuſt acte, cauſe of the others ruine. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royke</hi> Prince (reſerued to accompliſh more difficult atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps) reioyced at their follies, when hee knewe what credit was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his counterfeiting ſquire, neuer ſuffitiently prayſing
<pb facs="tcp:13977:149"/>
the excellent perfections of the Princeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> iudging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fate to none other but to her ſelfe due. Who with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care poſſible paſt the day imagining in what imminent perrill ſhe had put the Prince, though the confidence ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his valour, made her more aſſured then the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. When they ſawe tyme the twoo Ladyes by little and little, conuayed the armour into the Garden, that the Prince might there arme him, and alſo his ſwoord which ſhe had demaunded of her Vncle, onely that ſhe deſired to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould the brightneſſe, that being drawen it yéelded: he gaue it her not thinking on the good hee did, for had it béene with any other he could not but hardly eſcape in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaile. They aſcended to the toppe of the tower, where the luſtie youth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them in his apparell, and ſo ſtrong that in all his life he knew not when better he felt himſelfe, ſo great was his deſire he had to be reuenged on thoſe Traitors. The Ladie embraced him with theſe words.</p>
               <p>Sir Knight I ſo feared yeaſter-days combate, becauſe I was armour-leſſe, that I durſt not come vnto the ſecond w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, though in your preſence mine will but little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: Wherefore I will giue you your ſwoord, for it was not lawfull it ſhoulde come to another Maiſter hauing been y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréeke Princes, becauſe it were ſo to wronge him. Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is that it now receaues (deuine Ladye anſwered hee) that hauing béen in your beauteous handes, it ſhoulde come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt vnfortunateſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlds wide continent. Name no more that fearefull Epetithe (ſayde ſhe) for you make me thinke you are ill conditioned to loue, one of the worſt parts incident in any gallant, for he, that the power of diſfauour forceth to deny y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his fortune in his good imployment is the apparent witneſſing, hee not ſo much eſtéemes his Ladye as hee ought, for if ſhe liues beloued, a diſfauour at their handes muſt bee accompted a greate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
               <p>Your excellent beautye (replyed the Prince) hath greate reaſon, and I confeſſe my fault, for all it procéeded from an
<pb facs="tcp:13977:150"/>
amorus paſſion. Whatſoeuer how great ſoeuer, (ſaid the Ladie) procéeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Loue, is worthie of pardon, for none that truly loues is ſubiect to any on the earth but to the thing loued, which is eſteamed for life, reputed for a lawe, honoured as a King, and obayed as a Lord: and ſince in loue nothing is required but a perpetuall acknowledgement thereof, héere let vs no longer ſtaye, but inſtruct <hi>Fauſta</hi> in what ſhe hath to doe. <hi>Paliſandro</hi> ſhall doe that (replied the Prince) who muſt ſtay with her, ſuffering none to come in with any light, and when the challenge is knowen, then publiſh my extremitie to be moſt.</p>
               <p>Héereuppon deſcended the twoo chiefe Beauties of the world into the garden, where (O <hi>Archyſilora</hi> who ſhoulde haue tould thée ſo, with what gréefe wouldeſt thou haue heard it?) is it poſſible thou ſhouldeſt be ſo careleſſe, as not to reſpect the loyaltie of the Gréeke Prince, who being alone with her that challenged equalitie of thée, remembred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the battaile, armor, and horſe chéefly? She gaue him a ſtéeled temper one of the beſt that the earth poſſeſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This (braue Prince) was his that rayſed the buildings of this Cittie, of which a wiſe man tould me, that it ſhould come to the handes of the famouſeſt Knight, and greateſt Louer of the world, and with it he ſhould terminate many haughtie aduentures, and I thinke in all thinges hee did lye, except in this, for comming to your handes the earthes glorie doth ingraten them. It is a guift (moſt ſoueraigne Ladie ſaid he) to end any enterpriſe, hauing béen obtayned, by the woonderfulleſt hap euer recorded. The Ladie had in that nothing miſſaide, for that (next to the Creator) in a thouſand places it did ſaue his life, the firſt being in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile againſt the fearefull <hi>Ballurdano,</hi> for ſo was the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Gyant called. The Prince did put it on hauing neuer as he thought ſéene a better in all his life, and ſhee cloſed the buckles with more grace then ſtrength. Hee made an end of arming, and his armour being of a roſe colour graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with gréene ameld flowers, he reſted the beſt accompliſht
<pb facs="tcp:13977:150"/>
knight that might be ſéene. The beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> could not but imbrace him, ſaying.</p>
               <p>In this doe I now wrong <hi>Archiſilora,</hi> but ſo I may with truth ſay I had the flower of Knighthood twixt mine armes, I am bould to doe it, vowing héereafter to amend it with my vtmoſt power.</p>
               <p>With whatſoeuer gracious Princeſſe your Highnes ſhal vnto me doe (replied he) I am the man that onely thereby gaines, though I wiſh my friend were in my place. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch there muſt be nothing, but ought to be participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twixt both.</p>
               <p>Now am I ſorrowfull that I did it, for (ſaid ſhe) it is the greateſt wrong my fauors could receaue, ſeing you tell me, that not louing your friend, I am the looſer, being, before I am intreated, vſed with ſuch diſdaine: and till another time I will deferre my reuenge for this iniurie. When it ſhall pleaſe you (gallant Ladie replied hee) will I receaue the paine of your inflicted puniſhment, though ſéeing it muſt procéede from theſe hands I wrong it with that name: here ending, ſhe led him to a wicket that to the fieldes did open, made with barres of ſtrongeſt ſtéele: and opening it with a kiſſe, ſhe ſayde.</p>
               <p>I would to God (renowned Prince) I were a Knight in this Iourney to accompanye you, the better to ioy your haughtye Cheualries. It ſuffizeth, for my glorie and the happye ſucceſſe of them, Heauenly <hi>Venus</hi> (anſwered hee) that in your name I vnder-goe them: Yet yf that were ſo (replyed the Ladye) more ioyfuller ſhould I remayne. So here departing ſhe gaue him a Thouſande imbracemenets ſuffitient to Metamorphize the weakeſt Lambe, into the ſtrongeſt Lyon.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ound in his ſoule till death (ſwéet Ladies) did the mightie Nephew of <hi>Trebatio</hi> leaue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie of <hi>Xantho,</hi> ſéeing with what care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kindnes the beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> had procured his libertie, &amp; ſo he fully reſolued, either to looſe his life, were it ten times ten thouſand times more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or elſe to take her thence, eſpowſing her vnto his friend (if ſo ſhe would) and that ſhe ment it he had receaued ſome hopes therof from her in the tower the firſt night. The ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of his vndertaken enterpriſe (though of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) could not diuert him finding himſelfe alone, amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt thoſe big branching oakes, from remembring the tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, wherewith he was vſed forgetting his promiſe of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the ſame night hee paſt vnto the Princeſſe, (but there can be none being in his eſtate.) He ſate him downe at the foote of a ſpreading Béech, making the Eccho of his voice reiterate the repetition of his woes, and tempering them with the fauours the Princeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> had done him, he warbled foorth this Dittie.</p>

Turbulent ſtormes are theſe, which only a hart with paſſions vnacquainted may diſtinguiſh, and he ſhall ſée the reaſon he hath, not to complaine for that were to wrong the Ladie, but to publiſh his gréefe, &amp; his vnluckie happe to ſée himſelfe, his loues &amp; hopes diſgraſte? I know not (deuine Ladie) wherein I haue offended, vnleſſe it were in making thée ſoueraigne Dominatrix of my ſoule: And if becauſe this <hi>Monarchie</hi> is too ſmall I doe deſerue ſo cruell an exile: In that I did preſume to acknowledge it, I now languiſh in eternall puniſhment for that offence, &amp; doe not behould thoſe twoo celeſtiall ſunnes of thine, the lodeſtarres of mine affects, the guiders of my actions, and the light to lighten my eternitie. Now baniſh from my friends ſocietie, I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der through vnknowen groues and deſert wilderneſſes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Not farre from him was there a Knight with different thoughts, for he only ſorrowed for not hearing from his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, hauing aſſurance by his good fortune that he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly

trauell amiddeſt his greateſt abſence: hee roſe for through like tempeſts hee had recouered the quiet harbor of a delightfull loue: Hee cloſed his viſor and went were he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-heard the knight, &amp; hauing done in his going made ſome noiſe which was a warning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> louer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> claſping his beuer ſtarted vp, &amp; by the brightnes of the Moone they could ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewe each other. Either admired the others diſpoſition. Straight did the Gréeke knowe the Knight by his armour, reioycing to méete him there in ſuch time, attributing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a happie conqueſt to his aduenture: for hee that he ſawe was no leſſe then the gallant louer <hi>Don Eleno</hi> Prince of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> who by order of <hi>Nabato</hi> that fore-ſaw <hi>Claridianos</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie would helpe his couzen by ſending him thither, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he nothing erred, for few elſe with honour could haue ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated that battle. What is it you require (ſir knight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the glad Prince) for if of my perſon there be anye néede, I will imploy it in any danger to doe you good? I was only hither moued to come (replyed he) by hearing thy lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations (braue Knight) and the recompting of thy griefes to theſe ſenceleſſe trées reſolued to looſe my life, or to my power redreſſe thy woes. For ſuch a knight leſſe could not be hoped (anſwered the Gréeke) although the infirmitie that poſſeſſe me cannot be cured but by my death. To deſpaire was yet in ſuch caſes neuer good ſayd the <hi>Dacian</hi> he ſpake by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,) for ſometimes the Lady giues a Thouſand diſfauors, onely better to proue her louer, ſpecially if hee bee a perſon whom the Vulgar ſort admireth, &amp; ſo ought they to be taken as fauors. Neuer were any I haue receaued (ſir Knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he) which haue byn infinite called by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in middeſt of them would my grieued life finde content, but ſo plainely ſhe tould me, how little ſhe reſpected my actions, that I thought it was to wronge her longer to abide in her preſence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to liue in this country many miles remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from my owne. I greatly deſire to know in what king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we are, for this is the firſt night that I arriued in the land, &amp; after we will trace ſome plot for your remedy. In all
<pb facs="tcp:13977:152"/>
things I wiſh to ſatiſfie you (ſir Knight) replyed the Prince becauſe I iudge your perſon worthy of much more obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And therefore know you are now in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of <hi>Eſclauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> &amp; very nere the famous Citie of <hi>Xantho,</hi> where w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in theſe few daies there hath happened many things amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was the comming of a knight called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deſpayrer, who va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht foure brothers that the Princeſſe beauty defended, &amp; from thence he tould him all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the former Chapters haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zited. So that ſir Knight the worthy in the yellow with his Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion muſt die through the greateſt iniuſtice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, And imbouldened with his Iuſtice not my valor, I left this night the Citty, reſolued to returne vpon the mornings ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to demaund the combate, though I greatly doubted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe conſidering the aduerſaries fiercenes. But my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune that neuer is weary to perſecute me, ordayned that in my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming forth (hauing occaſion to alight, &amp; tie my horſe vnto a trée) certaine théeues did take him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, &amp; wold not ſtay my iuſt reuenge I woulde haue taken, hauing at ſuch a time bereft mee of my ſtéede, not giuing them occaſion for it. Truely (ſir knight anſwered the <hi>Dacian</hi>) you accompliſh the valor of your bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty, in hazarding your life in ſo iuſt a cauſe: &amp; though my deſerts containes not what ſo haughty an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize requireth, I offer neuertheleſſe my perſon, to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you till death, defending any from receauing outrage, or wronge, and want, I hope you ſhall not a horſe by ſome meanes or other. I doe not doubt it (replyed <hi>Claridiano</hi>) for we haue time ynough, &amp; ſo he thanked him with ſoueraigne prayſes his bounteous offer, which coulde by no leſſe degrée be correſpondent to his gallant diſpoſition. But little reſted the two kinſmen, with diuerſity of thoughts: And therefore ſcarce had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> golden ſhepheard regent of the worlds ſplendor ſhewen his light but they ryzed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valiant <hi>Dacian</hi> preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the Gréeke the beſt horſe that euer the world knew.

                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:153"/>They had ſcarce gone out of the wood when from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they ſpyed a Knight comming horſt on a mighty Courſer and ſéeming of great valour: Lets returne into the thicket (ſayd the Gréeke) ſir knight, for if any thing befall me with this Knight, none may witneſſe it but theſe trées, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a man to doe ſuch trickes, it is no infamie. The <hi>Dacian</hi> turned his horſe highly pleaſed with the Knights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour. Alreadye approched the Knight, careleſſe of that which happened: before him did <hi>Claridiano</hi> ſet himſelfe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A fauour ſhould I receaue (ſir Knight) yf you would tell mee whither you trauell. No further (ſayd hee) but to walke into theſe fieldes and run my horſe, becauſe for a good one it was giuen me. I am verie glad thereof (replyed the Prince) for now to a man that hath ſuch néede of one and of a ſhield as my ſelfe, and going to ſo difficult a buſines, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating you to lend it him you ſhal nothing looſe therby, but it wil rather be a liberality that wil more aduance your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for I muſt combate with this Knight, &amp; he onely ſtayes till I get one. I would gladly pleaſure you therein (replied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight) but truely you demaunde a thinge that neuer was ſéen, &amp; I had rather take the battle for you. That maye not be (anſwered the Gréeke) for he hath challenged me, and I muſt defend my owne honour: Yf he muſt ſtay for you (ſayd the Knight) you ſhall not want occaſion, to gett one by ſome other meanes, for this is impoſſible. My patience (replied the Prince) cannot brooke ſo long a ſtay, &amp; therefore you ſhal giue it me, or your life vpon it. With the point of his launce would the knight haue ſtrucke him, but ere he could turne it the Prince had taken it out of his hand, &amp; caſting his ſtrong armes about him, he pluckt him from his ſaddle, his ſhield falling from him to the grounde: what the Gréeke did was an act worthy of <hi>Claridiano,</hi> for houlding him between hys armes wyth a ſwinge, hee flunge hym aboue 20 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him falling with a heauy fall among certaine thorns &amp; bryers, that before he roſe, the Gréeke was gott within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cittie, for quicker then an Eagle taking the ſhield he leapt

a horſe-backe, ſaying. Lets goe ſir Knight, &amp; pardon mee yf in any thinge I haue diſparedged your eſtate by my deuiſe, for beléeue me my preſent extremetie vrged mee to no leſſe. The <hi>Dacian</hi> could not aunſwere him for laughing: but hys Dwarfe ſayd. In fayth (ſir Knight) you are ſo nimble in it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I dare ſay you haue vſed this office aboue once. Thereby (anſwered he) maiſt thou gather in what neceſſities I haue bin, for in them there is nothing ſeueral to one alone, &amp; ſo as much was this horſe mine, as his that brought him: I am ſure he curſes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law that any ſuch thing doth allow ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dwarfe. Yf he doe ſo (anſwered the Prince) that of a good man might haue moued him of courteſie to haue done it, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my preſent want requeſted it. And becauſe (ſir knight) we are ſo nigh the Cittie, lets not looſe our ſelues, or vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly caſt our ſelues awaye, by reaſon I am ſo greatly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen here and therefore it behooues you to ſpeake, yf you do not ignore the language, demaunding battaile for the ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned Knights, the one called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <hi>Suſpitious.</hi> As you (ſir Knight aunſwered <hi>Don Eleno</hi>) will haue it, ſo ſhall it be, and belieue mee, I neuer delighted I in any knights company more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with yours. That is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to good men (replyed <hi>Claridiano</hi>) that with their vertues adorne him whoſe parts deſerue but meane regard. Thus arriued they at the pallace about Ten of of the Clock, when the King was in the great Hall, ſhewing ſome exterior ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diſcontent for the newe infirmity of the diſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Knight. Then entred the two moſt graciouſeſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth, who with a Soueraigne behauiour hauing made their due obeyſance, with an audible voice the <hi>Dacian</hi> thus began. It is ſo little ſince we ariued in thy kingdome, (Might king of <hi>Eſclauonia</hi>) this knight and my ſelfe, that we more deſired thy high ſeruice, (by reaſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great fame that of thee the waſt orbe doth publiſh) then by other means to procure thy diſpleaſure. But hauing vndeſtoode the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of two Knights, we are conſtrayned, they bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing challenged, and their owne perſons from the fight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited,

to vndertake it for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, only relying on their Iuſtice (if any they haue) and not on our weake valours. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding to you Knights (replied the King) for the kindnes you offer me, the which I ſhall not want will to gratifie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occaſion to ſhew it. As for the reſt the battaile cannot be denied to any that for them will vndertake it, if they pleaſe to giue their conſent, for which let them be ſent for. Straight went they that had charge of the Priſoners to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them: But the diſcréet <hi>Paliſandro</hi> made the Kings Nephew belieue that the Gréeke was at the point of death, who ſtept to the bedſide without light telling him what did happen. With no little feare did <hi>Fauſta</hi> anſwere, that ſeing hée could not goe, hée rezined his power to the ſuſpicious knight, admitting whatſoeuer he ſhould doe. With this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply returned the young man the which the King allowed, &amp; it highly contented the Lady <hi>Venus</hi> that in her face till then had changed to more colours then the Raynebow euer had, awaighting for the anſwere, wherwith ſhe reioyced, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſight of her fréed knight, who had brought ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him in her iudgement of no leſſe valour then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Preſently came the Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> that was adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without feare to graunt the battaile to any that ſhould demaund it: he greatly thanked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for what they did, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So ſtrange (Braue Knights) is this countreys law, that it conſtrayneth vs in neceſſitie, to trouble thoſe whome moſt we ſhould deſire to ſerue. It is not any for vs (Sir knight) ſaid the <hi>Dacian,</hi> for contentedly we ſhall die in your ſeruice looſing our liues my companion and I, and ſeing we néed no more delay be our battaile ſtraight. This could not <hi>Balurdano</hi> diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſitting by the King ſaid. Make not ſuch haſt (knights) to ſéek your deaths, for you ſhall haue time y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, &amp; yet now knowing you muſt haue it againſt me, I feare you do repent your fooliſh hardines. Conſidering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire wee haue (replyed the Gréeke counterfeiting his voyce more furious then a Lyon) to chaſtice thy mad inſolence we ſtay to long.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13977:155"/>The beauteous Dames and rareſt Ladies to ſée by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the power of their working beauty, came glad, vnto the field (making that more brighter then the imperiall heauen, becauſe glorifyed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> radiant ſplendor of more dazeling Sunnes) with admiration to eternize that warre. And once againe with more attention &amp; ſilence awayted the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant louers, the diſcharging of euery blow, for euery one y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was worthy note procéeded from the force of loue. And all in generall greatly argued which of the two Knights ſhould be moſt valerous, for both ſo well pleaſed with their gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the ſpectators that moſt with a partiall voyce expected the combate. Of thoſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that leaſt feared was the Princeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> none who at that inſtant accompanyed with manye Ladies, more glorious then <hi>Apollos</hi> ſhine, had ſet her ſelfe at her windowe that ouer the Knights looked, all apparelled in gréene to let the diſpayrer know how much ſhe relyed on his valour. On her head a Coronet of her owne haire ſhee had ſet, remayning with ſuch a naturall true perfect beauty, that I know not who at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie ſight would not haue made her Soueraigne of his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Is this the Lady (demaunded the <hi>Dacian</hi>) gainſt whome the wrong is done and we ſéeke to right? And I thinke it a happy lyfe to looſe it in the ſeruice that ſhal aduance her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: For her beauty doth deſerue it, and few or none there is that may compare with hers. It is ſo? Braue Knight (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Prince) that you may knowe what fauour wee haue on her behalfe. The noyſe that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common people made with the comming of the Gyantes, interrupted their talke from farther procéeding. Many Knights &amp; Nobles to pleaſe the Kinge, and the Prince <hi>Lindauro</hi> accompanied them, yet none would they truſt with their heauy weapons, but their owne timbered ſhoulders. Both had one deuiſe on their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> coulord armour, grauen with many Lillies on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, &amp; were mounted on mighty horſes, for ſuch they had néed be to ſupport their hugenes. Hauing marſhalled the field w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vſuall rites they ſet the Knights each oppoſite againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:13977:155"/>
and the Iudges tooke their places. <hi>Balurdano</hi> was by nature ſo inſolent, that ſéeing they ſomewhat ouer-long did ſtay, ſaid: haue done with your new inuented foliſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for longer you are about them, then I vſe in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a pitched field? Peace proude helliſh beaſt (ſaid the Gréeke him hauing ſorted and required for his enemie) for now thou art in place, where déedes muſt more helpe thée then arrogant vaine boaſting woordes. He would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, for he could not his rage ſo choaked him. He turned his horſe with ſuch a curuet that aboue foure tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, borne to armes and valour. All of them placed themſelues to fling againſt his enemie, thinking the fearefull ſignall ouer-long was kept. But (O yée Angels of chaſtitie, <hi>Veſta's</hi> only vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and Ladies of all rarieties) you that hitherto diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with deſire haue expected this inſtant: now ſetled before the ſacred ſinode of your perfections, in preſence of your ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall beauties, they beſéech that with all intention poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you make them Victors, with your conquering lookes: For conſidering the ligeritie of the foaming <hi>Tyrio</hi> champing on his bit, no maruaile if by a little diuerting your ſunny eyes, you looſe the enioying of ſo braue an encounter as the <hi>Dacian</hi> made, who being mounted on the earths beſt horſe was firſt in méeting of his enemies. They encountred with more terror then the noiſe of two diſcharged fild Cannons. That happened to the Sonne which the Father would not haue beléeued, for the bigge launces ſhiuered in thouſand péeces, they met ſo furiouſly with their horſes, that the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with his tumbled to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground ſore bruiſed with the fall. The luſty <hi>Tyrio,</hi> by the force of the ſhocke was driuen back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thrée or foure ſteps ſo diſorderly, that the <hi>Dacian</hi> to auoyde occaſion of ſome diſgrace, leapt from him like to a long wingd hawke, leauing the behoulders not a litle affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionated to him, and no leſſe the beauteous <hi>Venus</hi> that in her hart reioyced with the braue encounter that the Knihgt had made. All the ſpectators commended him with loude voices not regarding the gréefe that the King and the <hi>Sophy</hi> might
<pb facs="tcp:13977:156"/>
conceaue with that ſucceſſe, imagining that the Knightes would beare away the victory of the fight, ſince the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhew it by ſo gallant an incounter. But ſtay a while &amp; you ſhal ſée what our Gréeke doth, that backing his ſtolne horſe repreſenting <hi>Mars</hi> on earth but far more angry, tooke his Carrier ſomewhat long, to take ſurer ayme with hys launce. They met, like the incountring in the wide vaſt <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean</hi> of two well furniſhed ſhipps carryed with the furye of contrarious windes. Timerous in ſight ſemed the vgly gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant mounted on ſo great a Courſer: but he that was borne without feare, ſtronglye reſting his launce ſtayed it in the middle of his ſhield that in fouldes excéeded <hi>Aiax:</hi> yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not it reſiſt the ſtrength of that <hi>Herculean</hi> arme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eaſily pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it with his breſt, caſting a brace of launces on the other ſide vnder his arme. All the ſpectators thought he had ſlaine him, but it was not ſo, for it onely paſt twixt his armour &amp; coate of male, yet he thruſt him ſo hard, that he threw hym from his ſaddle, tumbling like a Rocke vppon the ground. And the Gréeke guirded his horſe ſo ſtrongly with his leggs for feare of falling, that, with the ſtrong incounter, he made his Courſer burſt vnder him. He would not ſo long ſtay, but in ſight of all the place, ſetting his hand on the pummell, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch lightnes he leapt forwards ouer his necke &amp; head, that on his féet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſword in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled very neare where the Gyant, with great payne was ryſing. He helped him with a lofty floriſh, that finding him ſomething careleſſe yt ſtrucke away all the helme top and part of his armed ſcull, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding him a litle on the head: he returned with another before he could be ſetled on his féete that almoſted had layde him againe alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, which lighting on his viſor, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his front, it made him a long and daungerous wound.</p>
               <p>Neuer was the like afore ſéene in that place, which made the beholders ſéeke newe meanes of prayſes for the knight, ſaying aloude, it was impoſſible for <hi>Mars</hi> to doe, with what ſuch facilitie the Gréek had done. The gallant <hi>Venus</hi> alone celebrated in her ſoule the Gréeks haughty Chiualries, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:13977:156"/>
there none with whom ſhe might communicate them. Of higher eſtimation, (ſeing what he did) was the Knight reputed then the <hi>Dacian.</hi> Who emulating the ſound of thoſe high lawdes, with his inchaunted <hi>Romaine</hi> blade made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Gyant, and in his firſt aſſault he ſtrucke the more to mayme him vpon his ſword arme.</p>
               <p>That was not a place ſtrong ynough to reſiſt the blow, &amp; therefore was it to ſome effect, for it tooke away all his defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue armour, with a great piece of the maled ſléeue. To his defence came y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gyant entring with his left foot forwards. It was what the <hi>Dacian</hi> deſired: For by his nimbleneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding the blowe, (for on foote his companion hadd no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ouer him) he gaue him another on the toppe of hys helme. He ſtretcht not foorth his arme to much fearing his aduerſaries lightnes, and therefore was not his blowe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, neuertheleſſe it cut away all the Collet of his plumes, and with them, a great péece of the Burgonet with ſome of his ſcull. Yt deſcended to his ſhoulder bearing away a péece of the fine ſtéeled Targe, that in ſtead of a ſhield he vſed. It did not a little auaile him to leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purſuite of his aſſault, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gyant turning his heauy Semiter, diſcharged it in middeſt of his ſhéelde. It did not cut it, but it ioyned yt with ſuch ſtrength to his heade, as if a Tower had fallen thereon.</p>
               <p>It made him ſtagger two ſteps backward. He followed him cloſe thinking hee had him ſure with a mighty thruſt of his ſharpe ſword. Aduiſed was the <hi>Dacian,</hi> and ſo expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him opening his legges to ſtande more firmer: all was little ynough, for a Thouſand ſignes of falling didde hee make: Hee was ſo abaſhed heereat, that like a Lyon hee turned vpon his enemie. At once they diſcharged ſuch mighty blowes, that at the noyſe all the fielde left ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gréekes combate to gaze on this.</p>
               <p>His knees bended <hi>Don Eleno,</hi> thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the lateſt mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his life hee ſo felt the blowe: the bloode that through his
<pb facs="tcp:13977:157"/>
Beuer yſſued witneſſeth aſmuch. Hee ſo remained, for ſo ſoone to riſe he had not power. The Gyant did the like, with his ſword hand vpon the ground, wanting al that part of his helme, with a moſt dangerous wound on his right ſide, and the ſword deſcending to the breſt, though thrée fold double it was it cut it downe right vnto his thighes, with al his coate of male. Trembling like a ſhaken ſappling w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Boreas</hi> breath ſtoode the knight Iudging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battle loſt, the like did <hi>Lindau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> with the ſight of ſuch blowes, who ſitttng next the Kinge was animated by him ſaying, he ſhould not grieue thereat, for he purpoſed to deny the priſoners. Hereuppon they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to wonder at the Gréeke, for the earth contayned not a better ſight, then to behould, the ligeritie, &amp; ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he combated and had couered the gyant with his own blood, he ſtayed for him, for he well ſaw his amazednes, ſo did the Gyant (who in that ſcience was moſt ſkilfull) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing the Gréekes intent, whereby both ſtoode fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The furious Gyant woulde execute his blowe which was the Gréekes deſire, the which hee had ſcarce intended, when ſwifter then a bird he cloſed, letting fly at his knées to make him forſake his ſtanding: but his nimbles yſſued too coſtly, for the <hi>Pagan</hi> being Maiſter of his arme ſtayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blow till then, diſcharging it with his ſtrength vppon his helme. Miraculouſly héere God defended him, (for his head hée had ſtrucke cleane off, bearing aloft his blade) yet was it ſuch a one, that it cut away part of his burgonet wounding him a little on the head, it made him fall on his face, a thing that all the place hung the head to ſée, eſpecially y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beauteous <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> that in hart ſhed teares of blood, ſeing the diſgrace of her Princely Champion. Héere the Nephewe of great <hi>Trebatio</hi> was not ſlow nor remiſſe (for it is dangerous in war) quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetting himſelfe on foote, not loſing his blow prepared. It was venturous, and that which to his little coſt did aſſure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory, for it cut him to the bone, making a fount whence procéeded more blood then had an Oxe béen there kild. Forth
<pb facs="tcp:13977:157"/>
ſtept the Gréeke, ſaying. Now ſhalt thou ſée (infernal beaſt) that here do déeds more auaile then inſolent proud words, &amp; that thou maiſt know gainſt whom thou fighteſt, I am the Deſpayring Knight. Some feare conceaued he at the name ſeing himſelfe ſo ſore wounded: But his pride was ſo great y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſalued that ſaying. Then ſtay baſe Knight, &amp; thou ſhalt ſée how neither heauen, nor earth are able to kéepe thée from my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, by which I wil diſioynt thée bone by bone. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he wold haue flung after him (which had bin his death) for his knée vnable to ſupport him, hee ſtaggred that hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fell with his head forwards. The Gréek ſeing it, thoght himſelfe ſure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory, &amp; ſo deſirous to terminate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war, he toke his ſword with both hands, letting it fly at his head, with all the ſtrength that he could fetch. He miſt his blowe, which cauſed in many great griefe, ſtriking his ſword vpon the earth that therein it ran to the middle, himſelfe falling vppon the pummell.

wonder of all that beheld the battaile. The furious Giant for all he was maymed, would go to helpe his ſonne: but <hi>Claridiano</hi> ſtept before him ſaying. Stay vilde beaſt for ere he returne vnto himſelfe, thy head ſhalt thou leaue with me. He warded a ſtronge blowe which made him ſee more ſtarres then did the Heauens containe: yet was it no part to driue him from caſting his <hi>Herculean</hi> armes about him. The like did the <hi>Pagan,</hi> but wanting one arme, and his mortall wound on the knée, with a trippe he fell with the Louer vpon him, that not forgetting his dagger, thrée times he ſtabd it in his body drawing it foorth with his hart blood, Concluding that warre with the fierceſt <hi>Pagan</hi> of all <hi>Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> himſelfe remayning ſo weary that not able to ſtand he made a ſeate of the Gyants tronke, making all the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors laugh to ſée what ſtoole he had found. The <hi>Dacian</hi> was alredy riſen, excéeding glad to ſée that the knight had ended his battaile. He continued not long with his, for hauing his aduerſarie mortally wounded with two blowes he laid him on the ground, &amp; following that aduantage with like kinde of death that the Father ſuffered, he was bereft of life. Which <hi>Don Eleno</hi> made cleane his ſword and dagger prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him that deſerueth all praiſes, from whome procéedeth ſtrength and victorie. He mounted vppon his light horſe that ſtraigght came to him, giuing cauſe of no leſſe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at that, then what the Gréeke did do, for finding hard by him <hi>Ballurdanos</hi> ſtéed, that was both mightie and ſtrong, not ſetting foote in ſtirrop, he nimbly leapt into his ſaddle as if that day he had done nothing, which euery one ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedly admired ſeing him ſo ſore wounded. They demaunded of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudges if about the Priſoners libertie there remayned any more to do: They replyed.
